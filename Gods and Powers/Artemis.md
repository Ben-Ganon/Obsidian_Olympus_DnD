***Description:***
Goddess of the hunt, wild animals, archery and the Moon.
Artemis is the cold, calculated hunter all animals fear on instinct.
She is swift, silent and deadly, stalking her prey and delivering deadly volley's of enchanted arrows.
She is the most reserved of the gods, not distracted by the pleasures other Olympians indulge, neither of flesh nor leisure. 
Her only goal is to hunt the mythical beasts who roam the land, and she is sworn to eternal virginty. Twin goddess to Apollo.
