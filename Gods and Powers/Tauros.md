Tauros is the ancient bull god that reigned terror over the ancient Minoan Empire.
Primordial and older even than the Olympians, Tauros represents both the raw power of nature and the intense allure of mysterious sacrifices in the dead of night.
The powers he gives to his believers and children, then, are a mix of combat prowess and hades-like shadow magic.
