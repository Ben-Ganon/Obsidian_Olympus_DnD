***Description:***
Dionysos is the god of wine, parties, and pure madness.
Dionysos is the youngest of the Olympian Gods, but make no mistake- there is an ancient madness in his eyes, and his constant drinking does not help.
His status as god of wine and parties often lead people to think of him as a lighthearted party deity, but make no mistake:
Dionysos is prone to turn you mad as he is to celebrate with you.

Children of Dionysos play a dual role - support the party and poison enemies, either with tainted wine or with insanity.
