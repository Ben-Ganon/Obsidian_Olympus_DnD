***Description:***
Poseidon, God of the oceans and brother to Zeus and Hades, is his more relaxed, but nonetheless powerful parallel on Olympus.
Poseidon rules the oceans, the tides and all creatures within.
While Poseidon is not as temperamental as his brothers, the ocean can still be calm and flat as black mirrors in the night, or crush ships in it's rage.
A force to be reckoned with, Poseidon grants extraordinary boons both in combat and utility
