***Description:***
Hephaestus is the god of the forge, fire, blacksmithing, stonemasonry and other crafts.
Hephaestus is described as incredibly ugly, and can mostly be found diligently working his forge on mount Olympus.
He is extremely interested in the events that happen on Olympus, especially those that include his wife Aphrodite.

Children of Hephaestus play as masters of fire and arms, especially armor.
They can help their party equip massively powerful artifacts that grant, for a short time, the power of Hephaestus,
Or drown their enemies in fire and sword slashes.
