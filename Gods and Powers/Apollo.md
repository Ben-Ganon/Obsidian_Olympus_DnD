***Description:***
Apollo is the god of music, archery, medicine, Prophecy and the sun.
Apollo is described as being heavenly handsome, even for a god, and has the ego to match.
His natural good looks and talents have made him a care-free, jovial god who doesn't care much for conflict or heroes.
He's still quite deadly with a bow, and uses this talent to deal with nuisances from afar.

Children of Apollo play can play as devoted healer and bard, or deadly archer.
