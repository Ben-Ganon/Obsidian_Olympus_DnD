***Description:***
Hades is the god of the dead and king of the underworld.
Bitter, angry from his lot in eternal life, Hades sulks in the underworld, away from his godly family. 
Don't be fooled by his childish behavior, behind the sulky anger lies true power over the underworld and all the realms within.
