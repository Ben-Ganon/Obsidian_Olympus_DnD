Demeter is the goddess of agriculture and harvest.
Usually kind and forgiving, Demeter is the easing and homely presence on Olympus. 
Lately, Demeter has grown cold and bitter - crops fail to yield and the ground is almost frozen solid.
Her previously warm  demeanor has been replaced with an icy rage.


Children of Demeter are usually very weak in combat, but the sudden shift in their godly DNA has causes a shift in their personality - now they are more dangerous than ever.

Children of Demeter play a crow control oriented roll, tending to keep enemies at a distance and allowing their party to strike harder.
