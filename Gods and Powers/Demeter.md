Demeter is the goddess of agriculture and harvest.
Usually kind and forgiving, Demeter is the easing and homely presence on Olympus. 
Lately, Demeter has grown cold and bitter - crops fail to yield and the ground is almost frozen solid.
Her previously warm demeanor has been replaced with a malevolent, icy rage.

Children of Demeter are usually very weak in combat, but the sudden shift in their godly parentage has caused a shift in their personality - now they are more dangerous than ever.

Children of Demeter play a crowd control oriented roll, tending to keep enemies at a distance with traps and vines and allowing their party to strike harder, then dealing massive damage to enemies they have [[Afflictions#Ensnared |Ensnared]]
