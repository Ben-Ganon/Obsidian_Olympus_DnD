![[Athena.png | 300]]
***Description:***
Athena is the goddess of wisdom and strategy.
As her domain implies, Athena is extremely sharp and tends to think things through.
Usually the voice of reason among her fellow Olympians, Athena represents the cold, 
calculated side of the pantheon.
Do not confuse her restraint for excess patience: Athena can and will dominate a battlefield given a proper reason to fight

Children of Athena play a mixed role of fighter who stacks block bonuses to deal massive damage and soak up attacks, and a tactician that gives their team incredible bonuses if they are organized and given a plan.
