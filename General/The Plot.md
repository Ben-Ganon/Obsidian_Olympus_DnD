The $Plot^{TM}$ so far:
The year is roughly 900 bce.
500 years ago (roughly 1450 bce) the island of Crete and surrounding Islands were populated by the Minoan Empire. 
At the head of the Minoan Empire ruled Minos, the dreaded tyrant from Knossos. 
Minos was a demigod, born of the [[Zeus]] and Europa, and resented the gods of Olympus - both his father Zeus for abandoning him in childhood and Poseidon for cursing him with the bull that fathered the dreaded Minotaur.
Slowly losing his mind from anger and jealousy, Minos turned to another god:
Unearthed in a hill in Crete,  a small statue of a bull imbued with an ancient god erupted in Minos' hands, granting him dark visions of the bull god Tauros.
These visions corrupted Minos' mind, but granted him great power (<mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">TODO</mark>: write god page for TAURUS).
With his new found power Minos founded the Minoan Empire, which conquered the islands near Crete and subjected them to slavery and suffering expanding his empire and worshiping Taurus.
The Greeks on the mainland feared the rise of this empire headed by the mysterious blood-hungry god, so they called out to Olympus to help. 
Olympus, joining forces with demigods who's names are lost to time, vanquished Minos and obliterated his empire.
Crete was drowned in ash and fire, consumed by great waves and choked by thunderstorms, collapsed on itself, its citizens fleeing or choosing to die with their beloved homeland.
The few survivors of the disaster, known formally as "Minos' Apocalypse", swore to avenge their nation and to ruin Olympus.
500 Years after Minos' Apocalypse, the Cult Of The Bull is trying to bring the Olympus down.
At the head of the cult is Aphelios. Aphelios is the direct descendant of king Minos, and is determined to bring him back from Hades.
Sailing his ruined home island Crete, Aphelios recovered the statue of the bull and inherits the powers of Taurus. 
With Taurus' guidance, Aphelios starts the Cult Of The Bull. 
They perform a forbidden ritual, and with the power of Tauros they chain Persephone, goddess of spring, to the Temple of Tauros at Crete.
They hope to cause Greece to crumble:
Make the gods on Olympus point fingers and fight amongst each other to distract them from the eternal winter caused by Persephone's absence.
With the gods distracted and the citizens of Greece starving, the Cult will  invade Greece and trap Hades, forcing him to return Minos.
Our Heroes are in Athens for the summer solstice, (which looks like winter solstice because Persephone). 
Zeus sends Hermes to assemble them.
The heroes must travel to the island of Crete and free Persephone, defeat Aphelios and save Greece!
