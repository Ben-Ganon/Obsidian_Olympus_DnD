- How turns work - Action + movement + bonus action:
	Each turn in combat is roughly 10 seconds, equal to 1 CT.
	The battle is split up into turns according to Agility rolls, meaning the person who rolled the highest agility goes first, and his turn lasts 1 CT.
	Each CT, a character can do two things: move, according to their Movespeed (Meters/Second) and attack.
	Instead of attacking, Characters can take other actions, such as using a Boon, doing some action in the world (Trying to knock over a small statue takes 1 CT).
	Some actions take no time at all and they are defined as Instant Actions.
	These include scoping the battlefield (Intuition Roll) or using Boons with Cast Time Instant. 
	This can be done at any point in the turn.
	
- Sizes and their effects on combat:
	Each creature has a size: Small, Medium or Large.
	Small creatures gain +1 to dodge and Agility rolls, and large creatures gain +1 to block and Might rolls.
	Some boons grant the ability to change size.
- Attacking with weapon:
	To attack with a weapon, roll its offensive value.
	The target can then choose to block the attack with their shield or weapon (according to their defensive stat), or dodge the attack with an Agility roll.
	
- Firing arrows:
	First, to fire an arrow one must have a bow and arrow ammunition.
	To fire an arrow, you must roll the offensive value of the bow for damage.
	If the target is in the range of the bow, this is treated like a normal attack.
	If the target is outside the range, you must first succeed on a Dexterity roll to land the attack.
	In addition to this the target can still block/dodge the arrow.
	
- Blocking with a shield or with a sword - what can/cannot be blocked:
	You can block an attack from a weapon or arrow with the defensive stat of your shield or sword - you must roll a 4 or more to succeed the block.
	You cannot block blows from Large creatures, or special effects from Boons (Waves, Lighting strikes, etc.)
	
- Damage reductions:
	Your armor can reduce the damage you take (if an attack lands) by a fixed amount (1-8 flat reduction).
	Additionally, magical armor can reduce some damage from magical abilities.
	
- Grapples:
	You can choose to grapple an opponent to the floor, pinning them down and fighting them in close combat.
	During this time, any weapon other than knives/ small axes gain -3 to their damage rolls.
	The grapple is done by a Might roll.
	To exit the grapple, the target must succeed a might roll.
	
- Attacking with a Boon:
	Some Boons have offensive capabilities. 
	If a Boon says Instant cast time, you can use it as a bonus action at any point during your turn.
	If a Boon says it takes 1 CT to cast, then you must use your action on that turn to cast it. The Boon takes effect immediately after you finish casting it.
	If a boon has X CT cast time and Y CT Duration, then you cast it during your turn for X turns, and it lasts from the moment you finished casting until the end of the Y turn after the cast.
	For example 2 CT cast time and 3 CT Duration goes:
	| Cast | Cast | Effect | Effect | Effect | Regular Turn
