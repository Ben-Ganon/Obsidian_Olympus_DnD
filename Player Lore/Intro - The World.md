The year is 431 BCE.
The world is alive with magic and mystery - minor gods and monsters roam the lands. 
Nyads inhabit the lakes and streams, Dryads dwell in ancient trees, and Satyrs can be seen playing pipes in the forest. 
Above it all, on Olympus, the twelve Olympian Gods enjoy their golden age - with their Titan parents vanquished, and at their most worshipped, and thus most powerful, the Olympians revel in their marble mansions atop the legendary mount. 
Their parties are infamous, their dazzling visages gleaming in Godly light no mortal can comprehend. 
The good times are upon us! The Gods are happily complacent.
That will be their downfall.
Meanwhile, Human society is in it's infancy - small towns and occasionally small cities can be seen scattered around the Greek peninsula and many islands surrounding. 
The meagre Human population rightfully worships the gods for their power and beauty, but as Olympians bask and gorge and laze, the Humans toil. 
The Humans suffer. Their resentment grows. It gnaws. It consumes them. Even as desperate prayers are loudly spoken, sung, screamed to Olympus, the silence of the Gods is the loudest sound in the heavens. 
There are other Gods out there, waiting to be unearthed, waiting to be worshipped, waiting for their turn atop the mountain.
