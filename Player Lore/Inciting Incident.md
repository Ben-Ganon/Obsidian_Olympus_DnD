Atop Olympus, madness has taken hold of the Gods.
Persephone, the Goddess of spring, has vanished!  
In her absence, the land has fell into an eternal winter.  
On Mount Olympus, the Gods are raging, yelling insults, pointing fingers at one another and hurling whatever is in sight, in a childish attempt to resolve the issue.  
The classic suspect is Hades, who has already kidnapped Persephone  once before. 
"You idiots, she's my wife! Why would I kidnap my own wife!? we already have an agreement that she stays with me three months of the year, but the winter months have come and gone and she is nowhere" 
Muttering their apologies, the gods settle down and start to think about who the culprit could be...  
Athena chimes in "This seems like a plot to either divide or distract us, but who would want to see us lose? and what don't they want us to notice?"  
Hades replies, in a snarky tone "Who wouldn't want to see you lose? you're not exactly the nicest bunch on the block"  
"watch your tongue hades, the only reason we tolerate you here is because of this emergency" Ares sneers, a glint of challenge in his eyes. "I'll see to it you're back in your realm before you can say 'Tartarus' "  
"**SILENCE, YOU BICKERING CHILDREN!!**"  Zeus roars.  
"I will not have you fighting amongst yourselves while we deal with possibly the most dire threat since Kronos. Athena, do some reconnaissance and try to find out who this could be. I doubt it's one of the Olympians. Hades and Poseidon, do a sweep of your realms to see if anyone is acting odd or missing. The rest of you, be on high alert, kidnapping a god is no easy task, so we are dealing with something powerful here. Oh, and Hermes?"  
  
"Yes boss?"  
"Remember when I told you about the group of exceptional demigods assembled in Athens for the Summer Solstice?"  
"Sure thing boss!"  
"now would be the time to fetch them for a quest"
