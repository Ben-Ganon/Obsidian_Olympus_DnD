The $Plot^{TM}$ so far:
The year is roughly 900 bce.
500 years ago (roughly 1450 bce) the island of Crete and surrounding Islands were populated by the Minoan Empire. 
At the head of the Minoan Empire ruled Minos, the dreaded tyrant from Knossos. 
Minos was a demigod, born of the [[Zeus]] and Europa, and resented the gods of Olympus - both his father Zeus for abandoning him in childhood and Poseidon for cursing him with the bull that fathered the dreaded Minotaur.
Slowly losing his mind from anger and jealousy, Minos turned to another god:
Unearthed in a hill in Crete,  a small statue of a bull imbued with an ancient god erupted in Minos' hands, granting him dark visions of the bull god Tauros.
These visions corrupted Minos' mind, but granted him great power (<mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">TODO</mark>: write god page for TAUROS).

With his new found power Minos founded the Minoan Empire, which conquered the islands near Crete and subjected them to slavery and suffering expanding his empire and worshiping Tauros.
The Greeks on the mainland feared the rise of this empire headed by the mysterious blood-hungry tyrant and his bull god, so they called out to Olympus to help. 
Olympus, joining forces with demigods who's names are lost to time, vanquished Minos and obliterated his empire.
As punishment for its attempt at domination, Crete was drowned in ash and fire, consumed by great waves and choked by thunderstorms, collapsed on itself, its citizens fleeing or choosing to die with their beloved homeland.
The few survivors of the disaster, known formally as "Minos' Apocalypse", swore to avenge their nation and to ruin Olympus.

500 Years after Minos' Apocalypse, the Cult Of The Bull is rising in the Mediterranean.
At the head of the cult is Aphelios, grand war-chief and coordinator of the cult.

Aphelios was raised by a generation of survivors. Hungry. Mad. Insulted.
Aphelios wants nothing more than to see Olympus in ashes.
Sailing to his ruined home island Crete, Aphelios recovers the statue of the bull and inherits the powers of Tauros. 
Tauros guides Aphelios to revive the Minoan empire, but because of the domination of Greece in the Mediterranean he must do so through the Cult of the Bull.
Aphelios is a direct descendant of king Minos, and is determined to bring him back from Hades and with his help conquer Olympus, and then all of Greece.
With Tauros' guidance, Aphelios starts the Cult Of The Bull. 
They perform a forbidden ritual, and with the power of Tauros they chain Persephone, goddess of spring, to the Temple of Tauros at Crete.

They hope to cause Greece to crumble-
Make the gods on Olympus fall to in-fighting to distract them from the eternal winter caused by Persephone's absence.
With the gods distracted and the citizens of Greece starving, the Cult will  invade Greece and trap Hades, forcing him to return Minos.

Our Heroes start in Athens for the summer solstice, (which looks like winter solstice because Persephone's absence). 
Zeus sends Hermes to assemble them.
The heroes must travel to the island of Crete and free Persephone, defeat Aphelios and save Greece!

#### Phase 1: 
The Heroes must make their way to Delphi to receive the Oracles quest and her blessing.
Unbeknownst to them the Cult of the Bull have poisoned the oracle, giving Tauros a 
peek into the future.
The Heroes must kill Aphelios second in command, Selena, who has been controlling the oracle for a few months now.
After Selena has been defeated, the heroes will receive [[The prophecy from the Oracle]]


##### Phase 2:
Our Heroes must make their way to Knossos, Crete.
The heroes must make their way from the Athens agora, and make their way to the docks. 
There, a number of ships await:
- Albatros
- Delfini
- Karchar√≠as
they must sail south to the island of Crete.
On their way, they will encounter sea monsters, stop on mythological islands and fight monsters.
Island options:
- Delos, birthplace of Artemis and Apollo
- Naxos, where Zeus received his thunderbolt and where Theseus left Ariadne
- Thera (Santorini) - Final battle in Minos' Apocalypse
