The Heroes are gathered in Athens for the summer solstice.
The weather is foggy, grey clouds smothering the sun, bitter cold biting into all.
The Athenians, wondering what could have stopped summer from coming, hold the festivities at the temple of Athena anyway.
Unbeknownst to our intrepid Heroes, the cult of the bull have infiltrated the Temple of Athena and are looking out for Heroes on quests to aid the Olympians.
Player_A, which is in a stall in the market, is checking out the poor, shriveled produce from the fields.
Player_A had received a mysterious papyrus containing an invitation to the summer solstice in Athens. 
It wasn't signed by any of the temples, and it had an odd glow to it, so Player_A decided the best course of action would be to follow the instructions and show up.
Likewise, the rest of the party received similar scrolls and decided to show up to the solstice to check things out.
The party meet in a vegetable stall, notice each others mildly glowing scrolls.

Suddenly, Player_A notices their purse of coins is no longer on them.
They look up, and see a thief run away with it.
before they give chase, they see Hector hunting him down and absolutely going to town on him.

[Intuition] They see he takes a small, eye-ish looking object from the thieves robes, and run into an alleyway.

Player_A and Player_B Chase (?) Hector through the streets, but lose him quickly.

Hermes, on a quest from Zeus, appears before Athens and declares a quest is underway to aid Olympus.
