The Heroes are gathered in Athens for the summer solstice.
The weather is foggy, grey clouds smothering the sun, bitter cold biting into all.
The Athenians, wondering what could have stopped summer from coming, hold the festivities at the temple of Athena anyway.
Unbeknownst to our intrepid heroes, the cult of the bull have infiltrated the Temple of Athena and are looking out for heroes on quests to aid the Olympians.
Player_A, which is in a stall in the market, is checking out the poor, shriveled produce from the fields.
Player_A had received a mysterious papyrus containing an invitation to the summer solstice in Athens. 
It wasn't signed by any of the temples, and it had an odd glow to it, so Player_A decided the best course of action would be to follow the instructions and show up.
Player_B is on the opposite side of the market, looking at silver jewelry to bestow on their beloved back home in Thebes.
Player_B had also received a letter much like Player_A's, and had decided to come to the summer solstice.

Suddenly, Player_A notices their purse of coins is no longer on them.
They look up, and see a thief run away with it.
before they give chase, they see Hector hunting him down and absolutely going to town on him.

Player_A and Player_B Fight (?) Hector and retrieve the Top of [[The Black Key]]

Hermes, on a quest from Zeus, appears before Athens and declares a quest is underway to aid Olympus.
