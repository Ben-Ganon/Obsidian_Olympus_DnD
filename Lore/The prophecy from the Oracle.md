***The moon child you did slay
But the journey is not done
All of Greece will know dismay
Unless the quest is won

___On the isle of Thera
The Fates have no hold
Dreaded war-chief Aphelios
Has reaped fates untold

___To the birthplace of Minos you must sail
Save Olympus from the fire and the hail
A band of heroes, assembled before us
Shall break or mend the horns of Tauros

___The chorus sings praise
For our heroes, fierce and brave
Death lies in Hades



***Delphi liberated

***From child of moonlight so hated

***But the journey is not done

***All of Greece shall be lost or won

***Ancient chains to Thera bind

***Echoes of Olympians so kind

___To the End of Minos you must sail

***Save Olympus from the fire and the hail

***Band of heroes, Seek out Naxos

***Break or mend the horns of Tauros
