***The moon child you did slay
But the journey is not done
All of Greece will know dismay
Unless the quest is won

___On the island of Delos
The Fates have no hold
Dreaded war-chief Aphelios
Has reaped fates untold

___To the birthplace of Minos you must sail
Save Olympus from the fire and the hail
A band of heroes, assembled before us
Shall break or mend the horns of Taurus

___The chorus sings praise
For our heroes, fierce and brave
Death lies in Hades
