The Black Key is a key that opens one of many randomly spawning back doors to hades.
The Key was separated by Nyx, daughter of Hades.
Each part of the key gives unique Bonuses and they each attract each other, if in 1 Meter range they snap together with a strong magical force.

Black Key Top:

The strongest part of the key, on its own.
The Top of the key allows the holder to see five minutes into the future once a day. This brief vision lasts only seconds but is extremely accurate given the short time frame it has to predict.

Black Key Blade:

The Black Key blade is the glue holding the key together and as the name implies, it helps keep the holder close to their mind.
Once a day, the blade gives +1 to a <mark style="background: #A5A5A5;">Willpower</mark> or <mark style="background:  #FFAD0085;">Intuition</mark> roll meant to resist a psycological effect.

Black Key Bit:

Once a day, gain the ability to pry open any door or obstacle with a key hole.
