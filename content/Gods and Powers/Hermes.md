***Description:***
Hermes is the god of travel and travelers, merchants, doctors, thieves and a psychopomp - a guide of souls into the afterlife.

Like his titles would imply, Hermes serves as Olympus' main messenger, as he can travel swiftly to all ends of the earth - even hades.
Hermes, being a god of thieves, is naturally sneaky and very fond of pranks.
Light hearted and child-like, Hermes' is an incredibly well liked god among Olympus.

Children of Hermes play as either a shifty rogue, zipping between enemies to kill them quickly or a jack of all trades that has many tools the party can benefit from.
