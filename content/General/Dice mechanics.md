In the Olympus DnD game, every attribute (strength, agility, wisdom ) value corresponds to a different dice roll (in character sheer.
For example, having an Agility Value of 5 will mean you roll a D6 for agility checks. 
having a value of 12+ means rolling a D20.
Getting a +1 on a roll means upgrading the dice you roll with (+1 on a D6 means a D8, +2 on a D8 means D20 and so on)
Having a value that is beyond the maximum (for example having 13 strength and then getting a +1 for strength rolls means you roll a D20 twice, then take the highest value)
