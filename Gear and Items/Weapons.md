##### Akinakes
![[8._Akinak_(dagger)_bural_mound_Arzhan_(VIII.-VII._B.C.)_Tuva.jpg | 200]] 
A small, easily concealed knife.
Can be thrown a short distance, and is exceptionably good at close-range grappled combat.

##### Xiphos
![[Xiphos-Title.webp | 300]]
The classical Greek short sword. 
All around alright offense and defense.
Can be used in grappled combat.

##### Kopis
![[AH2151-1.jpg | 200]]
The Greek long sword.
Curved slightly at the blade and longer than the Xiphos, the Kopis is an excellent tool to keep an enemy at a distance, and has great offense with decent defense. Because of the longer blade, is unusable in a close-range grapple.

##### Dory
![[8046128_orig.jpg |300]]
The Dory is the classic Greek infantry spear.
It can be wielded either dual-handed or one-handed.
The two handed grip prevents the use of a shield but does incredible damage.
In the one handed grip, the spear has less force behind it, but allows for a shield.
Can be thrown quite a range for significant damage.

##### Labrys
![[AH3935_L.jpg | 200]]
The Labrys is a short, double-bladed axe.
This axe is a great all around weapon suited for multiple situations - 
It can be throw, can be used in a grapple, and has decent damage.

##### Toxo
![[long-bow.png | 300]]
The Toxo is the Greek hunting bow.
Made of simple wood, it has limited range and damage.
Beyond the firing range, a Dexterity roll success is required to hit a target (not including a block by the target)
The arrows fired by a bow cannot be dodged, only blocked.
Firing a bow requires the user to see clearly, so they cannot fire while equipped with a helmet.
##### Syntheto Toxo
![[Mongol_bow.webp | 300]]

##### Syfri
![[Photo+Nov+30,+6+11+57+PM.jpg | 250]]

##### Sagaris
![[Indo-Persian_war_hammer.jpg | 100]]
The Sagaris is a war hammer, capable of dealing great damage while completely ignoring armor. Because of it's weight requires dual wielding.
