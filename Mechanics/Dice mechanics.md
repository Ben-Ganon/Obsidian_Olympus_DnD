- In the Olympus DnD game, every attribute (strength, agility, wisdom ) value corresponds to a different dice roll (in [[Character Sheet.pdf]]])
- For example, having an Agility Value of 5 will mean you roll a D6 for agility checks. 
- having a value of 17+ means rolling a D20.

#### DC Checks
- The DC (Difficulty Check) for each different action changes according to its difficulty
- There is not specific number for each difficulty, but a good rule of thumb:
	- 2-4 - Pretty easy, any regular average human could do it no problem, examples-
		- Picking up a small rock
		- Hitting a big target 1 meter away with a small rock
		- Avoiding the gaze of a blindfolded man
		- Convincing a starving man to eat
		- Perceiving a nearby building on a clear sunny day
	- 5-7 - This action is relatively difficult and takes certain skill/practice/luck, examples
		- Picking up a large rock
		- Hitting a small target 10 meters away with a small rock
		- Avoiding the gaze of a guard in pitch-black darkness
		- Convincing a man to eat something pleasant-looking you gave him
		- Perceiving an eagle on a cloudy day
	- 8-13 - This action is quite difficult and usually cannot be done by the average human, needs extraordinary amount of skill and/or practice, insane luck or some magical force
		- Lifting a Boulder
		- Hitting an eagle in flight with a bow, from the ground
		- Sneaking past a guard in daylight
		- Convincing a man to drink a mysterious clear liquid
		- Perceiving the hat on a man 500 Meters away
	- 14-16 - this action is very difficult, only Heroes, Gods, magical creatures, and the very lucky can manage these
		- Lifting a house
		- Hitting a swinging rope with a bow from 500 Meters away
		- Sneaking past a guard who is looking right at you
		- Convincing a man to drink an ominous black liquid
		- Perceiving a guard in a tower 1000 Meters away
	- 17-20 - This action takes insane effort even from Heroes/Magic Users/Extremely Lucky Sons of Bitches
		- Lifting a Mountain
		- Hitting a small bird with a bow from 1000 Meters away
		- Sneaking past a God
		- Convincing a man to drink what he knows is poison
		- Perceiving the man inside the building across the city
#### Godly Favor
- Whenever you achieve the maximum number on a die, gain **Godly Favor**, and roll the next die tier again and add the result to the previous roll
- This can happen infinite times
- **On failure of a check**, take 1 **Tear of Nyx**
- You can use **Tears of Nyx** to add to your rolls
- Also use to gain **Godly Favor**!
- Example 1:
	- I roll a d6 and get 6
	- I roll a d8 and get 7
	- Total for this check: 6 + 7 = 13
- Example 2:
	- I roll a d4 and get 4
	- I roll a d6 and get 6
	- I roll a d8 and get 8
	- I roll a d10 and get 1
	- Total for this check: 4 + 6 + 8 + 1 = 19
- Example 3:
	- I try to make a DC 8 Perception Check and fail
	- I take a **Tear of Nyx**
	- I try to make a DC 10 Might check with my D8
	- I roll a 7
	- I use the **Tear of Nyx** to gain **Godly Favor** and roll a d10 to get 3
	- My total is 8 + 3 = 11 and I pass the DC

#### Advantage:
- Getting a Advantage on a roll means upgrading the dice you roll with (+1 on a D6 means a D8, +2 on a D8 means D12 and so on)
- Having a value that is beyond the maximum (for example having 13 strength and then getting a +1 for strength rolls means you roll a D20 twice, then take the highest value).

#### Disadvantage:
- Getting -1 on a roll is exactly the same as getting +1.
- If you roll with a d6, and have -1, roll a d4 instead.
- If you are rolling with a d4 and have disadvantage, roll 2d4 and take the lowest result.

#### Stacking advantage/disadvantage:
- Advantage and disadvantage can stack - 
- If you have +1 from one source and -1 from another, you roll regularly.
- If you have +2 from one source and -1 from another, you roll with +1.

#### Opposed rolls:
- Opposed rolls are dice rolls you make vs. an opponent.
- You both roll the same stat (Might, Agility, etc.) and to "win" the opposed roll you must roll at least 1 more than your opponent.
- If you are making an opposed roll against multiple enemies, you roll only once.
