In the Olympus DnD game, every attribute (strength, agility, wisdom ) value corresponds to a different dice roll (in character sheer.
For example, having an Agility Value of 5 will mean you roll a D6 for agility checks. 
having a value of 17+ means rolling a D20.

#### Advantage:
Getting a Advantage on a roll means upgrading the dice you roll with (+1 on a D6 means a D8, +2 on a D8 means D20 and so on)
Having a value that is beyond the maximum (for example having 13 strength and then getting a +1 for strength rolls means you roll a D20 twice, then take the highest value).

#### Disadvantage:
Getting -1 on a roll is exactly the same as getting +1.
If you roll with a d6, and have -1, roll a d4 instead.
If you are rolling with a d4 and have disadvantage, roll 2d4 and take the lowest result.

#### Stacking advantage/disadvantage:
Advantage and disadvantage can stack - 
If you have +1 from one source and -1 from another, you roll regularly.
If you have +2 from one source and -1 from another, you roll with +1.

#### Opposed rolls:
Opposed rolls are dice rolls you make vs. an opponent.
You both roll the same stat (Might, Agility, etc.) and to "win" the opposed roll you must roll at least 1 more than your opponent.
If you are making an opposed roll against multiple enemies, you roll only once.

#### Combined Rolls:
Combined rolls are used when the action you are performing does not match exactly with the stats available to you.
For example, climbing a wall quickly takes both Might and Agility.
To do a combined roll, make a check with both stats, then average the results.
For example, if you try to scale a wall quickly with Might stat 6 and Agility stat 4, and you roll Might 5 and Agility 3, your final roll will be ${5 +3 \over 2} = 4$ (this roll succeeds) 

#### Types of Common Combined Rolls:
Deception - Intuition + Stealth
Intimidation - Might + Intuition
Investigation - Intuition + Dexterity
Athletics - Might + Agility
Acrobatics - Agility + Dexterity
Sleight of Hand - Dexterity + Stealth
Persuasion - Intuition + Willpower
