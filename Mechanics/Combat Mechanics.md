### How turns work - Action + movement + bonus action
- Each turn in combat is roughly 10 seconds, equal to 1 CT.
- The battle is split up into turns according to Agility rolls, meaning the person who rolled the highest agility goes first, and his turn lasts 1 CT.
- Each CT, a character can do three things: 
	- Move, according to their Movespeed (Meters/CT) 
	- Attack/take another action
	- Take a bonus action2
- Instead of attacking, Characters can take other actions, such as using a Boon, doing some action in the world (Trying to knock over a large statue takes 1 CT).
- Some actions take no time at all and they are defined as Instant Actions.
- These include scoping the battlefield (Intuition Roll) or using Boons with Cast Time Instant. 
- This can be done at any point in the turn.
- You can use the movement, action, and bonus action in any order.
- You can move, take an action (anything taking 1 CT), and do one bonus action each turn. 
- Additionally, you can cast unlimited boons in a single turn as long as they have cast time "Instant"
### Equipment
- A weapon or item is equipped to you if it is on your body, in a sheath or in a quiver that is on you.
- This means it has to be written somewhere on your character sheet, like so- 

![[Pasted image 20231103131033.png |150]]

- In this example, the character has a water pot, a knife (Akinakes), a sword (Kopis), a shield (Aspis), and bronze armor (Panoply) all equipped to them.
- The Ammo slot is only used for special ammunition types (like **magic** arrows) 
- You have an infinite amount of **regular** arrows to shoot.
- If you want to throw a knife or an axe, it must be equipped to you
- The Back Box represents a large equipped item - 
  You can still hold small things there (like a water pot or a knife), but can also store a bow or a spear there.
- The Extra Slots are small items - knives, pots, small orbs or any other small item.
- Each item and where it can go:
  Spears, Swords, Hammers, Bow, Lyre, Shields - Hands, Back Slot
  Axes, Knives - Hand, Back, Extra Slot, Ammo Slot
  Quiver - Ammo Slot
  Small items (pots, small orbs, small books) - any Slot
  Large Items (heavy pieces of wood, large pots) - Hands, Back

### Weapons and Inventory
- You can switch weapons during combat.
- If the weapon was equipped (written on the character sheet figure) but not in your hand, then is a bonus action and can happen instantly.
- If the Weapon is in your inventory, it costs 1 CT (one action) to swap them out.
- Likewise, retrieving any item not equipped to use in combat will cost 1 CT.
- A knife or axe that is equipped can be drawn and thrown as a bonus action.
- This means if you have a knife/axe equipped (or bow and arrow) you can fire a projectile / use the knife or axe in an attack and then as a bonus action in the same turn throw another knife/axe.
- Weapons can be dual wielded, but only one can be used each turn.
### Movement
- Movement is tile-based according to your Movespeed.
- Movespeed is in Meters/Turn.
- Your Movespeed is $2 \cdot Agility$.
- Every Turn, you can move up to your Movespeed meters, which on the board is 1 tile per 2 Movespeed.
- (For example, if you have 10 Movespeed you can move your character 5 tiles in a turn)
### Attacking with weapon
- To attack with a weapon, roll its offensive value.
- The target can then choose to block the attack with their shield or weapon (according to their defensive stat), or dodge the attack with an Agility roll.
- To do this, the target of the attack must make an Agility/Block roll of at least the attack roll
- For example, if the attacker rolls an attack roll to get 10, then the defender must make an Agility/Blocking save of at least 10 to avoid the attack altogether. 
- Melee attacks with a weapon can only be made to enemies adjacent to you (within 1 tile or 2 Meters).
- Some weapons (like spears) have longer melee range
### Ranged Projectile Attacks (Arrows/Knives/Axes)
- First, to fire a projectile one must have a bow or a knife/axe equipped.
- To fire the projectile, you must roll the offensive value of the bow/weapon for damage.
- If the target is **in range**, this is treated like a normal attack, and **reaches the target automatically** (Can Still be Blocked or Dodged)
- If the target is **outside the range**, you must first **succeed on a Dexterity roll equal to half the distance to land the attack**.
- For example, if an attacker uses a hunting bow, the attack automatically succeeds if the target is within 14 meters (7 squares). However, if the target is 20 meters away (10 squares), the attacker must succeed a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw to shoot the arrow accurately to the target. 
- In addition to this the **target can still block or dodge the projectile.**
### Blocking
- with a shield or with a sword - what can/cannot be blocked:
	- You can block an attack with the defensive stat of your shield or weapon - you must roll the same on block as the attack to successfully block the attack completely
	- You cannot block blows from Large creatures
	- You cannot block damage from magic like Boons (Waves, Lighting strikes, etc.)
	- **You cannot block arrows with a weapon**.
### Damage reductions:
- Your armor can reduce the damage you take (if an attack lands) by a fixed amount (1-10 flat reduction).
- Additionally, magical armor can reduce damage from magical abilities.
- *Regular armor cannot block blunt or magical damage.*
### Armor Rating
- Your Armor Rating (AR) is the amount of damage you block when a [[Combat Mechanics#Piercing Damage |piercing damage]] attack lands. This is calculated by summing all armor currently equipped to you.
- For example - a character equipped with Heavy Bronze Armor and a Corinthian Helmet has an AR of 2 (Bronze armor) + 3 (Corinthian Helmet) = 5.
### Critical Damage:
- When rolling for damage, if one of the dice you roll hits the maximum (4 for d4, 6 for d6, etc.), roll it again and deal extra damage.
- Does not apply to [[Combat Mechanics#Blunt Damage|blunt damage]] rolls.
### Grapples:
- **Grapple is a bonus action**
- You can choose to grapple an opponent to the floor, pinning them down and fighting them in close combat.
- During this time, only weapons with grapple stats can be used **(knife/small axe/hammer)**
- The grapple is successful if you succeed an opposed Might roll.
- Each turn the target can try to end the grapple. To successfully end the grapple, the target must succeed a Might roll.
- Until the target succeeds Might or you decide to end the grapple, the target remains grappled
### Attacking with a Boon:
- Some Boons have offensive capabilities. 
- *You must see the target of a boon if it is targeted ("pick a target in range")*
- If a Boon says Instant cast time, you can use it as a bonus action at any point during your turn.
- If a Boon says it takes 1 CT to cast, then you must use your action on that turn to cast it. The Boon takes effect immediately after you finish casting it.
- If a boon is Instant, and you cast it at the beginning of your turn, then it starts applying this turn
- If the duration is 1 CT, then the effect applies until your next turn.
- If a boon has X CT cast time and Y CT Duration, then you cast it during your turn for X turns, and it lasts from the moment you finished casting until the end of the Y of your turns after the cast.
- For example 2 CT cast time and 3 CT Duration goes:
- | Cast | Cast | Effect | Effect | Effect | Regular Turn
### Death:
- Upon the first time a Hero reaches 0 Hp or less, they are on the verge of death.
- Every turn, the Hero must roll a DC 4 <mark style="background: #A5A5A5;">Willpower</mark> save.
- If they acquire 2 successes, they revive with 50% Hp.
- If they acquire 2 fails, they die permanently.
- If they acquire 1 fail and 1 success, they revive with 1 Hp
### Attacks of opportunity:
If you are in an enemies attack range (melee weapon only) and move away from them, that enemy gets a free attack on you as you escape.
### Disengage
You can spend 1 CT as an action to disengage enemies and then move away, preventing attacks of opportunity on you.
### Heavy Armor:
- Wearing heavy armor makes you take less damage, but slows you down. 
- Remove 2 Movespeed when you equip Klimakas or the Corinthian helmet. (for each item equipped remove 2 Movespeed).
- Remove 1 Movespeed when you equip Panoply or the Chalcidian helmet. (1 for each item equipped)
- Equipping a heavy shield (Aspída Pórtas) removes 2 Movespeed as well.

### Damage Types
### Blunt Damage
- Blunt damage is done by hammers, some boons, and physical damage from various sources like falling or thrown objects.
- Can be blocked by shields
- Blunt damage ignores armor (regular and magical unless specified otherwise) and deals direct damage, but cannot crit.
### Piercing Damage
- Piercing damage is done by swords, axes and spears.
- This damage can crit (upon rolling the maximum number on a die) 
- Can be blocked by armor.
- Can be blocked by shields
### Magic Damage
- Magic damage is caused by  boons and other magical effects like fire.
- Cannot be blocked by non-magical armor or shields.
- Magic damage cannot be dodged or blocked unless stated otherwise.
### Reaction
- Boons and other effects that can be cast on your turn as a reaction, meaning they only trigger and start their effect when something happens
- This can happen not on your turn.
### Flanking
To Flank a target, two enemies must be on either side of them (more than 90 degrees separation).
Flanked targets have [[Dice mechanics#Disadvantage|Disadvantage]] on block and dodge attempts.
### Fall Damage
When a character falls, they take 1d4 damage for each 4 Meters they fall.
### Swimming
- When in calm water, a character can swim for half their movespeed.
- If the character is in heavy armor (Klimakas, Corinthian Helmet), They must make a Might saving roll each turn or drown, taking 1d4 damage and falling beneath the waves, becoming Submerged.
### Submerged
- Submerged characters move $1\over4$ of their movespeed. 
- Character in heavy armor must make a Might saving roll with disadvantage or take 1d6 damage at the beginning of each turn they are submerged. 
- A submerged character can take an action + movement on their turn to surface.
### Sneaking
- You can try to sneak up on a creature unseen.
- every movement you make towards or near the target/s, make a <mark style="background: #00BB4D;">Dexterity</mark> saving roll to determine whether you are seen.
### Sneak Attack
- If you have been unseen by an enemy until now and adjacent to them (on an adjacent tile or otherwise within 2 Meters of them) you gain a bonus <mark style="background: #930000A6;">1d6</mark> damage to whatever attack you make on them. 
- Sneak attacks performed with a Knife or Stilleto Dagger gain a bonus of <mark style="background: #930000A6;">1d8</mark> damage instead
- This breaks the sneaking, and all adjacent enemies are now aware of your presence. 
- PC's who try to evade a sneak attack suffer [[Dice mechanics#Disadvantage|Disadvantage]] to dodge and block attempts
