***Amara:***
Amara desires to find her dad, figure out what is the nature of the curse she is saddled with and maybe find a cure. Perhaps all three are connected.
The caves will show her what she wants the most, and probably the best place to start with: her Dad.
Amara sees a vision of her dad. 
Her dad can also see her - she does now know if this version of her dad is real or if the cave generated him, but she feels his answers are true
Her fathers name is Paris, and he is beautiful.
Paris was a blacksmith in Athens, when one night he met the most beautiful woman in the world.
What he knows- 
- Aphrodite came to him on a beautiful summer evening
- They made love and nine months later a beautiful baby girl showed up on his doorstep - she shockingly somehow looks exactly like Aphrodite
- Paris was heartbroken when Aphrodite left him
- Paris travels to a local forge near a volcano to seek guidance for making a set of armor that is both weightless and protective
- Paris unbeknownst to him met Hephaestus at the forge, who envied him for both his talent and his beauty
- Paris, during one night of drunkenness', let slip that the beautiful woman might be Aphrodite
- Hephaestus, infuriated by this cursed knowledge that his wife cheated on him yet again with this handsome talented stranger, cursed their unborn child to be a hideous monster - a gorgon
- Aphrodite, who took pity on the child, could not lift the curse itself, but could only bend it - granting the child shimmer to conceal herself from others.
- When the child arrived on Paris' doorstep, he thought at first he was given a monster
- Only her father could see her true nature, and spooked by the curse, brought her to the temple in a panic 
- The oracle shows Amara a vision of her father, and shows her an image of where he lives in Athens

***Adamantios:***
Adamantios is mad. really mad. Mad at his mother for abandoning him on a battlefield, mad at Sparta for their brutal slavery, mad at the world for how he was treated at every turn. also mad at the color red for some reason?
The caves will show Adamantios his flaws, and force him to choose what it is he values most - liberty, family, or blood
The cave will show Adamantios a choice - 
Adamantios is shown a bloody battlefield -
- To the North,  a roaring battle. He knows if he helps shift the tide, he can save many of his Spartan brothers. More importantly, he can win his glory and the respect he deserves.
- To the South, a slave ship is about to depart from the bay. He knows he is the only one strong enough to stop it - to free these people from befalling the same fate he has.
- To the East, he sees a small village. Straining his eyes, he can see horns on the heads of the villagers - he feels this is his mothers village. Perhaps he can receive the answers he so desires here - who was his mother? why did she leave him to this fate?
- To the West, an escape - a small chariot with bright red horses that Adamantios knows will take him wherever he wants to go. 

***Demi:***
Demi has many a revenge to execute, but her most urgent one is against Zeus - Why did he abandon her mother when she was most vulnerable?
Why is Demi so hostile to everyone she considers a threat?
The caves will try to test Demi, to make her see where her rage will take her
- She has Zeus on his knees, her blade at his throat. 
- Will she kill him? will she show mercy? 
- What does she say to him, in perhaps his last moments as a god?
- If she kills him - she sees the world fall into chaos - the titans rise again, the world at war without it's strongest protector - and Demi is in the middle of it all. 
	- Does Demi ascend the throne and become Lightning Queen of Olympus?
- If she spares him - Zeus asks her why, she has every reason to. 
  Zeus asks if she demands something of him in return? 
  a wish? 
  to become a god?

***Pierre:***
Pierre is a horny bull man in search of his goatly desires. He wishes only to become the best dancemaster after being defeated by his arch nemesis Alphonse, in an epic dance battle for his hearts desire, Felicite.
The cave will recreate this battle, but this time Pierre can win! he can show that dastardly Alphonse that he is worthy of Felicite's hoof. 
Will he choose to respect his rival in his victory, or will he choose to lose gracefully upon his demise?
