## Adamantios in Athens
- Adamantios is teleported to Athens from the oracle caves
- There he meet Apollo, who explains that the chariot was an ejector seat he didn't expect Adamantios to choose
- Apollo is willing to teleport Adamantios back, in exchange for a favor
- Lysander, after the heroes departed, took over Athens, and looted Apollo's temple, stealing the Golden Lyre
- Apollo can't get it himself, because a the Olympians would notice he let his Lyre get stolen, and he would never hear the end of it from Artemis
- Lysander has it in his mansion
- Lucky for Adamantios, Lysander is hosting a party tonight
- Apollo can disguise Adamantios as a city official (which he knocks out and shows to Adamantios)
	- Gregor Orthonos is the official
	- Theodore is also at the party as a personal servant to Gregor
- Adamantios needs to infiltrate the party, discover where the Lyre is and retrieve it
- Apollo tells Adamantios that when Adamantios will shout "Muses Help me", Apollo will teleport him out, with or without the Lyre
	- One room in the mansion is a treasure room with the Lyre
	- One room is a meeting room where Adamantios is talking about The Plan
	- One room holds captives from the temples, including Penelope Daikos

## The Oracle Cavern
- Selene and her Guard are sitting in the oracle cave - large hall
- The back room hold The Oracle herself, a young girl dedicated to Apollo
- When the party arrives, another hero by the name of Andreas has made it to the oracle, and is escorted by Selene to the back room to receive his Prophecy
- While they wait for her to finish, the party can investigate 
	- One room holds the Oracle herself
	- One room holds the previous oracle tenders, held in chains,
	  This room is hidden behind a secret door opened by a button hidden in the wall
- If the party does not find the secret room, Selene takes them to the back room to receive the fake prophecy and engages them, trying to kill them.
- Selene can notice the part of the Black Key sitting on the parties inventory (Ask them where it is before combat)
- After the party defeats Selene, they can receive the Prophecy from the oracle in it's full form
