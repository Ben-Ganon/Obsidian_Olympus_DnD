 The Cult of the Bull is a new cult created by Aphelios and Tauros to infiltrate Greece and influence the rising of the Minoan Empire.
 The cult worships the Bull God Tauros, and consider bulls a sacred animal.
 Their ritual involve acts of dismemberment and drunken, crazed parties that often end in intense violence.
 Aphelios has three lieutenants in the cult:
 
Selene, daughter of Artemis.
![[WhatsApp Image 2023-10-25 at 12.46.04.jpeg|400]]
She was born defying the sacred oath of Artemis to eternal virginity, so Artemis forced her father, a noble hunter from Crete, to abandon her in the forest to hide her shame.
Her father later snuck back in secret to retrieve her, and passed her on to be raised in secret by some farmers.
He told them the story, and they in turn told her. In time, Selene grew bitter and angry at Artemis for forcing her father to abandon her.
Even though her adoptive parents were loving and kind, Selene grew more bitter every day on the farm.
The farm work made her strong, large, and angry.
Angry at the world for leaving her for a life of work she thought below her.
Angry at her father for being a coward.
Angry at Artemis for breaking her vow and abandoning her "shame".
When Aphelios met her on his journey to Crete and offered her to join him on his quest to raze Greece, she happily agreed.

Aphelios appointed Hector, son of Janus, as her third in command.
Not much is known about Hector, as he usually keeps to himself.
However, a large scar on his face, which makes hector look quite disfigured, is assumed to be from Janus himself.

Atlas, son of Ares.
Atlas was born in a quiet town on the Egyptian coast to a martial artist named Cassandra.
When Ares showed interest in her prowess, Cassandra thought it was the best thing that could have happened to her, and sparred with him happily.
She would lose every time, and for a while they were happy.
After her son was born, Cassandra went back to sparring and through some turn of the fates, she beat Ares.
In his shame, Ares could not contain this defeat to a woman he once loved, and as punishment he drove her insane.
She tried to kill her son, but was stopped last second by her mother, Eleni.
Eleni, with no options left, had to kill her daughter.
She named her grandson Atlas, as a small retribution to the god of war. She raised Atlas to hate Olympus. When he was of age Atlas, now the strongest man in his village, ventured out to find a way to avenge his mother. 
At first he found nothing but pain, so in a bid to stop the pain and the voices from Ares telling him terrible truths, he joined the war on Sparta's side.
After many battles, in which he slaughtered enemies by the dozens, he finally gave in to the voices.
in a particularly nasty battle, he butchered his own unit after seeing that no more enemies were left for him to kill.
When the terrible truth of his actions made it to his mind, Atlas went on the run to Crete.
When he met Aphelios, he knew he had found the man who could finally rid him of his voices. By killing the fucking god who sends them.

Nyx, daughter of Hades.
When Nyx was a young girl, she discovered she had an interest with animals, but only dead ones.
She could, without much effort, make a dead cat get up and walk around, if only for a short time.
This, expectedly, caused Nyx to be bullied severely by the children in her village, and she learned the only solace she would receive would be from her "pets".
Her mother, who refused to tell her who her father really was, sent her away in fear she would become like him.
Mad at her mother and the world around her, Nyx develops an intense hatred for humans, and seeks out some kind of place she could call home.
Nyx roamed Greece, only to find a small entrance to a cave on the island of Crete, which she followed.
Somehow, the monsters and many dangerous obstacles were no challenge to Nyx, and she passed, untouched, into Hades.
There, she met a man who resembled her so much, a dark spark much like hers shone in his eyes. She knew she met her father
Nyx never felt so at home. 
Over the months she spent in the realm of the underworld, Nyx fell in love with it all. Cerberus, the lost souls roaming asphodel, and especially the strange Thanatos, manifestation of Death itself.
They developed an intense relationship, leading her to truly feel like someone understood her for the first time in her life.
But all was not well.
Hades, seeing his daughter gain respect and power in his realm, grew jealous, and cast Nyx out from his realm.
As a parting gift, Thanatos gave Nyx [[The Black Key]], which could open a back door to hades, should she ever want to come back to the underworld to see him.
Heartbroken by the sudden loss, Nyx grew tired of this world, and set to take her life the next day, just to force her father to let her rejoin the underworld, if only in Asphodel. 
In a surprising twist of fate, just as Nyx emerged from the underworld, she met Aphelios, who promised her this world, and hades with it, could end for all.
Seeing this as a much better option, Nyx decided this was the best path for her - slay her father, ruin the underworld, and reunite with Thanatos.

The Cult of the bull, lead by the three lieutenants, was sent to the gates of Hades at Crete, the Oracle at Delphi, and the island of Delos.
There - through her powers Nyx was able to avoid detection and open a small gate in Hades, through which souls could escape.

Atlas was able to lead the cult in Crete to chain Persephone to the temple, 

and Selene ventured to the Oracle to poison her and influence the fates.

Aphelios, meanwhile, has been leading a small scale invasion with the help of the undead at the island of Delos.
