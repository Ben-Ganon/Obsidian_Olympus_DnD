The $Plot^{TM}$ so far:
The year is 431 bce.
700 years ago (roughly 1100 bce) the island of Crete and surrounding Islands were populated by the Minoan Empire. 
At the head of the Minoan Empire ruled Minos, the dreaded tyrant from Knossos. 
Minos was a demigod, born of the [[Zeus]] and Europa, and resented the gods of Olympus - both his father Zeus for abandoning him in childhood and Poseidon for cursing him with the bull that fathered the dreaded Minotaur.
Slowly losing his mind from anger and jealousy, Minos turned to another god:
Unearthed in a hill in Crete,  a small statue of a bull imbued with an ancient god erupted in Minos' hands, granting him dark visions of the bull god Tauros.
These visions corrupted Minos' mind, but granted him great power (<mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">TODO</mark>: write god page for TAUROS).

With his new found power Minos founded the Minoan Empire, which conquered the islands near Crete and subjected them to slavery and suffering expanding his empire and worshiping Tauros.
The Greeks on the mainland feared the rise of this empire headed by the mysterious blood-hungry tyrant and his bull god, so they called out to Olympus to help. 
Olympus, joining forces with demigods who's names are lost to time, vanquished Minos at the island of Delos, and obliterated his empire.

As punishment for its attempt at domination, Crete was drowned in ash and fire, consumed by great waves and choked by thunderstorms, collapsed on itself, its citizens fleeing or choosing to die with their beloved homeland.
The few survivors of the disaster, known formally as "Minos' Apocalypse", swore to avenge their nation and to ruin Olympus.

300 Years after Minos' Apocalypse, the Cult Of The Bull is rising in Greece.
At the head of the cult is Aphelios, grand war-chief and coordinator of the cult.

Aphelios was raised by a generation of survivors. Hungry. Mad. Insulted.
Aphelios wants nothing more than to see Olympus in ashes.
Sailing to his ruined home island Crete, Aphelios recovers the statue of the bull and inherits the powers of Tauros. 
But, the Empire of Minos cannot be reborn just yet.
Over the past 300 years Tauros has been weakened, and Tauros now only grants Aphelios minor powers, and is more of a dark influence on the young man.
Minos, the vanquished king of the empire, took much of Tauros power with him to the underworld when he died.
To revive the empire and restore Tauros to full strength, Aphelios must merge with Minos to form the ultimate godly entity of the bull.
But, in order to foster these inherent powers into each other, a godly source of energy is required. 
That is why the Cult intends to sacrifice Persephone, and through her godly energy bind Aphelios, Minos and Tauros.

Tauros guides Aphelios on how to revive the Minoan empire, but because Tauros is so weak, Aphelios must first strengthen him with new followers, and so the Cult of the Bull is formed, collecting bitter demi-gods and other peoples from the Mediterranean, who wish to see Olympus fall.

With the renewed strength and influence all over Greece, Tauros is now strong enough to enact the next step of his plan.

Aphelios, on his journey to Crete, met his trusted lieutenants Nyx, Atlas and Selene.
He sends each of them out on missions with members of the cult.

They hope to cause Greece to crumble-
Make the gods on Olympus fall to in-fighting to distract them from the eternal winter caused by Persephone's absence.
With the gods distracted and the citizens of Greece starving, the Cult will invade Greece and 
Instate Minos as Emperor, with Tauros as the one and only god of the new empire.

Aphelios sends out his followers to do these:
1. Chain Persephone to the Temple in Delos to create an eternal winter
2. Overtake the Oracle in Delphi to shift the tides of fate in his favor 
3. Open the gate of Hades to release Minos

Nyx, Daughter of Hades, is sent to Naxos, where a new portal to hades has opened.
She will open a backdoor to hades with the Black Key, rescue Minos from hades and bring him to Delos, where Persephone is held to complete the ritual.
Along with Minos come other souls of the undead, and monsters from Tartarus.

Before she disappears into the gates in search of Minos, she splits the Black Key to three pieces to ensure the gate will not be closed, gives one part to Atlas, another to Selene and the third she keeps to herself.

After departing from the gate to hades, Selene is sent to Delphi to overtake the Oracle with the help of the cult, in order to blind the gods and prevent new heroes from trying to stop Aphelios.

Atlas is sent with some magically gifted followers to Thera, where they chain Persephone to the Ruined Temple of Tauros on the island.

During all this, Aphelios is ruling the Cult from Crete, and rebuilding the island.
Once Persephone is chained, and Minos is brought to Thera, Aphelios will join them and the ritual will commence.
Where the Minoan Empire was vanquished, it will rise once more, stronger, more dangerous than ever, 

Selene, on her way to the oracle, has her key piece stolen by an unsuspecting thief, and noticing he was heading towards Athens, sends Hector to retrieve it.

Our Heroes start in Athens for the summer solstice, (which looks like winter solstice because Persephone's absence). 
Zeus sends Hermes to assemble them.
The heroes must travel to the island of Crete and free Persephone, defeat Aphelios and save Greece!

During this time, Persephone has been missing for 6 months, Selene has overtaken the Oracle 3-4 months ago and Nyx is on her way to Minos in Tartarus.

Our heroes start their journey in the [[Athens Encounter]], receiving boons from Hermes and meeting Hector, Penelope and Lysander.

Unbeknownst to them the Cult of the Bull have poisoned the oracle, giving Tauros a peek into the future, while preventing the Olympians from seeing it.
The Heroes must kill Aphelios second in command, Selena, who has been controlling the oracle for a few months now.
After Selena has been defeated, the heroes will receive [[The Prophecy from the Oracle]]
