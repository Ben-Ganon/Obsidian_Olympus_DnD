The Athenian government is composed of 4 main bodies:

#### The City Assembly - Ekklesia
Composed of all people with voting rights in the city, the council gathers once a month to decide upon important matters, vote people into secondary offices, legislate rules and declare war.
The council includes all adult free men over 30 in the city who have enough land to qualify - around 2 square kilometers will do.

The council is usually disorganized and loses focus quickly on account of its many members, so other bodies of government must be used to carry out the will of the people.

The Council decides by direct vote - usually a vote is decided by clapping/stomping or by colored cards.

#### The Council of 500 - Boule
Chosen by vote from the Ekklesia, the council is the de-facto ruler of Athens, and are in charge of carrying out the votes the Ekklesia holds.
The council is usually composed of elder politicians with great standing amongst the people.

The Council prepares the Ekklesia meetings and meet every day to perform their duties.

#### The Courts - Dikasteria 
The Dikasteria are the judges of Athens, punishing those who defy the laws set by the Ekklesia. 
The Dikasteria are voted in by the Assembly, and must be scholars of age at least 50 who have served on the Boule at least 20 Years. 
The Dikasteria judge those who have wronged others or defied a law, and it is their responsibility that justice be delivered to them according to their crime. 

The Dikasteria hold great power over Athens, but through the power of the 3 main bodies of government balance is achieved.

#### The Generals - The Strategoi
Every 5 years, 10 generals are elected to lead the Athens military - during times of war and peace.
These generals are responsible for the training and leadership of the Athenian army, and any army in the Delian League.
They must be cunning, strong, and resilient to face both politics and battle and come out the other side unscathed.
The generals are exceptional individuals, chosen by the Council to serve Athens for 5 years. 
It is considered both a great honor and a great burden to serve as a general, as generals have incredible influence in the city politics and court system, but must lead the armies should war ever erupt - and it does often.
