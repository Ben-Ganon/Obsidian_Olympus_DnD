Son of Janus and third in command to Selene.
Hector popped up on the scene of Athens rather recently, and has remained a mystery to all who speak with him.
He refuses to speak about his past, or about the giant scar on the side of his face. 
The rumors say Janus gave him the scar as a second option to death for disgracing him with an incorrect ritual in his temple.
It is not illogical to assume then, that Hector was once a priest in Janus' temple and a horrible incident involving a ritual gone wrong has led Hector to seek out the Cult.
