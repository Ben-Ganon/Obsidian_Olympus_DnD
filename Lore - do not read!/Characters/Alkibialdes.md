Athenian general and part-time traitor, Alkibialdes was notorious both for his prowess on the battlefield, as a general tactician, in public debates in the [[Athens Government#The City Assembly - Ekklesia|Ekklesia]], and in the bedroom.

Extravagant, flamboyant and cunning, Alkibialdes rose to prominence through sheer intelligence and a habit of bedding many of Athens most high ranking politicians.
This cunning nature serves him well, especially when he defects to Sparta's side of the war later on.
