Grand Priestess to Athena at the Parthenos in Athens.
Demigod - daughter of Athena.
Growing up in extreme poverty, Penelope set her sights as high as she could.
After her mothers murder by  a Cult of the Bull member when she was 8, Penelope was left alone on the streets until she happened to encounter a priestess of Athena in the city. She showed her talents in logical philosophy and problem solving, and the priestess accepted her as an apprentice.
After being given an opportunity to grow, Penelope vowed to make the city safer, especially for women.
Because women could not serve on the council and vote, Penelope was forced to gain clout and influence through other methods - climb the ranks of the priesthood in the temple.
She made quick work of the priestesses, outmaneuvering her way into grand priesthood.
Now, with a position of power and a disdain for corruption and crime, she finds herself in a rather distressing position - her city is being slowly taken over by the Cult.
Recently, the hero of Athens Pericles, which Penelope rather liked, died immediately after finishing his life's work - the Acropolis and it's crown jewel - Athena Parthenos.
This opened the path for elections for a new general in the council, and who else would be chosen but Lysander, high ranking Cult of the Bull member.
Corrupt, cunning and vicious, Lysander is aiming to overtake all of Athens, starting with the priesthood.
Penelope is suspecting he is up to something sinister, and that he is planning a way to weaken the priesthood, and specifically Penelope.
How he plans to do this she does not now, but she suspects it involves invoking the rage of Athena at the priestesses.
While they engage in a cold war over the heart of Athens, Lysander and Penelope develop a bitter rivalry and she has begun her own plans to take him down.
She plans to out him as a Cult member, but how will she be believed?
Penelope, especially as a grand priestess of Athena, is held to a very high standard expected to be logical and show evidence of her claims.
She could use some Heroes to help her find some incriminating evidence on Lysander.
