Lysander Hasapis is a General on the Council of Athens, and high ranking Cult of the Bull member.
Demigod - Son of [[Dionysos]].
Growing up with an absent father was rough enough in Athens, but growing up with a drunkard mother was even harder. 
Lysanders mother, Agatha, did not take Dionysos' departure lightly, and has lost herself in alcohol and misery.
Lysander absorbed the brunt of the damage, having to scrape by to take care of his slowly wilting mother while she abused him, his face forever reminding her of a long lost lover.
He found he was extremely good at socializing and connecting with Athens' elite - something about the way he partied and always had a glass of wine full for them made the generals and judges spill all their secrets to him.
This granted him immense power, and eventually led to him acquiring many jobs as a high ranking Bureaucrat.
Eventually he was nominated for general on the council.
Lysander encountered Selene on a trip south in a boat to Crete to celebrate his nomination.
On their voyage back from Crete, Selene told Lysander there was an outlet to his rage and sorrow - join the cult and fight back against Olympus.
Lysander had seconds thoughts about the whole ordeal, he had heard many dark and sinister rumors about the Cult.
After his mother succumbed to the wine, Lysander decided he could not handle the grief anymore - he contacted Selene, and she welcomed him with open arms as her second in command.
Now, Lysander is looking to take away one of the god's most coveted possessions - their priests.
He plans to drive a wedge between Athena and her priestesses at the Parthenos.
At the Summer Solstice, there are many animal sacrifices to the gods.
However, Lysander knew well that the gods despised human sacrifices.
A shame if someone were to blackmail a child of Aphrodite on the council to use her Shimmer to disguise a small girl as a bull, and then drag the child to the temple to have her sacrificed to Athena...
