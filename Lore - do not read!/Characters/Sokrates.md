Sokrates was one of Athens' most famous scholars and philosophers, both for his wisdom and skill in debates, but most importantly infamous for refusing to write anything down.

When asked by a wealthy young man, “Is being good something that can be taught?” Socrates replied, “Far from whether it is teachable, I haven’t the faintest idea of what being good is.”

His main philosophic argument was that everything should be examined as definitions and without prior knowledge.
He loved testing professionals in their field - he would ask them to define their study, then ask more about a subject - and then point out when two definitions would contradict each other.
