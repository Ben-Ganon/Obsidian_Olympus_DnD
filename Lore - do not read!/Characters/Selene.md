Selene, daughter of Artemis.

She was born defying the sacred oath of Artemis to eternal virginity, so Artemis forced her mother, a noble hunter from Crete, to abandon her in the forest to hide her shame.
Her father later snuck back in secret to retrieve her, and passed her on to be raised in secret by some farmers.
He told them the story, and they in turn told her. In time, Selene grew bitter and angry at Artemis for forcing her father to abandon her.
Even though her adoptive parents were loving and kind, Selene grew more bitter every day on the farm.
The farm work made her strong, large, and angry.
Angry at the world for leaving her for a life of work she thought below her.
Angry at her father for being a coward.
Angry at Artemis for breaking her vow and abandoning her "shame".
When Aphelios met her on his journey to Crete and offered her to join him on his quest to raze Greece, she happily agreed.

Aphelios appointed Hector, son of Janus, as her third in command.
Not much is known about Hector, as he usually keeps to himself.
However, a large scar on his face, which makes hector look quite disfigured, is assumed to be from Janus himself.
