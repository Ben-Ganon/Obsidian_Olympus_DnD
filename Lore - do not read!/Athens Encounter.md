The Heroes are gathered in Athens for the summer solstice.
The weather is foggy, grey clouds smothering the sun, bitter cold biting into all.
The Athenians, wondering what could have stopped summer from coming, hold the festivities at the temple of Athena anyway.

Athens, even while shrouded in dark clouds and frost, still glimmers white and gold.
The massive stone temples strewn about the city and the acropolis almost seem to glow even if no light is shining on them.
In the streets, the citizens of Athens are a varied bunch: 
Vendors yell in the market stalls to sell produce, jewelry and other art.
In the docks, sailors are loading massive triremes with boxes of supplies and hoisting sails and oars.
Teachers and small classes sit outside, studying various sciences and philosophy.
In the slave district, chained slaves walk in long lines towards giant auction houses. 

On the day of the Solstice, a massive festival is underway.
On the streets, plays can be seen with large crowds attending. 
Stalls of food and drink are plenty, and the citizens partake with great gusto.
In the temples, prayers are being chanted to the gods, and many animals sacrificed.
The ruling class host extravagant parties, and even some common citizens are invited to join the merriment.
The cold does not stop the way of life here, but everyone can feel the weight of worry smothering the excitement.
There is worry winter will simply never leave, and with only a year's worth of food stored, this may be an inconvenient year, to say the least.
Even so, all of Athens is partaking in the events, hoping their sacrifices and joy echo to the heavens.

Unbeknownst to our intrepid Heroes, the cult of the bull have infiltrated the Council, and are looking out for Heroes on quests to aid the Olympians.

#### Amara
Amara, daughter of Aphrodite and a gorgon, is talking to a vendor near the slave quarters, trying to bargain for a better price for various pieces of jewelry. 
He tells her that she looks like his wife, who is missing - possibly defected or kidnapped by some cult she was obsessed with.
The seller, Gregor Othonos, a slave trader doubling as a seller in his booth, abuses a slave to go get the pretty lady something from the back.

#### Adamantios
Adamantios is on the opposite side of the stall, looking at shiny bronze swords and armor.
He listens in on the interaction with the slave and intervenes?


Later, the heroes are gathered at the newly built Parthenon for the main sacrifice happening soon at mid-day.
The Parthenon shines brightly, as if beckoning the people gathered to come closer and appreciate its marvel.
The impossibly tall stone columns almost seem to convey that they will always be above you, silently judging.
About an hour before the grand sacrifice, the crowd at the Acropolis is getting denser by the minute. 
Performers line the square, and vendors are at their peak activity. 
The hum and buzz of the crowd is almost deafening, but in a gentle, pleasant way.

Suddenly, a giant crack of thunder is heard throughout the city.
A lightning bolt strikes the main plaza. 
The plaza and people unharmed, the heroes can see an impossibly large man (around 2-3 meters in height) kneeling in the impact zone.
"Gods I'll never get used to that"
He rises up, snaps his fingers and the dust evaporates from him.
He looks to be quite young, simultaneously teenage and child, with golden eyes, shaggy brown hair and a quirky, mischievous smile.
In his hands, a large bronze staff is writhing - the Caduceus.
He seems quite twitchy, speaking fast and with a certain haste to his words - like he's trying to wrap up a meeting to rush home because his oven is on.
He starts to levitate slightly, and his voice beams across the Acropolis:
"Good citizens of our glorious Athens!"
The crowd is stunned. Everybody knows the gods exist, and many of them have seen both miracles and monsters, but having a god visit you directly is either incredible news or a terrible omen.
Considering the weather, the people in the Acropolis aren't very optimistic.
"I have come to aide you in your time of need!
You've probably noticed the horrible weather. 
Not my dad for sure. However, we're pretty sure this is because Persephone is missing".
Gasps arise from the crowd. How could a god be...missing?
"To tackle this, the Olympians have decided to assemble a small team of heroes to try to address this.. **Problem**"
A small scrolls pops into his hands.
He unfurls it, and starts reading:
"I am here by summoning our Heroes:
Amara, daughter of Aphrodite
Adamantios, son of Ares
___ ....
Step forward mighty Heroes, so that you may receive the god's blessings on this difficult journey"
The crowd is aghast with murmurs of excitement and anticipation.
Our heroes step forward tentatively, not knowing whether this spells glory or doom.

Hermes tells the heroes they are chosen for the task of finding Persephone, freeing her from her captors, and renewing the spring in Greece. 
Not a small task, and yet he speaks about it like it's getting some food from a vendor or delivering a letter - just another chore.
Hermes explains to the heroes they must consult the oracle at Delphi to officially start their quest. 
before they go, Hermes gives them some Boons from their patrons - a gesture of goodwill to show the Olympians care about their children. 
This doesn't exactly encourage our heroes, who may or may not have heard from their parents since they were born.

After his parting words, Hermes is gone in a flash of smiles and light.
The grand priestess Penelope is extremely concerned by this news and calls the Heroes for a brief on the state of Athens, hoping they can help her with the cult, who she suspects has something to do with all of this.

Lysander interjects - he would also like to speak to the heroes, mostly to influence or bribe them to abandon the quest and come party.

He tells them they should at least stay for the grand sacrifice, to pay respects to the gods who have just chosen them as their heroes.
In an odd turn of events, Penelope agrees, and this makes her extremely suspicious of Lysander - if she agrees with his line of thinking, he's probably up to something.

The priestess rolls out the sacred bull to be sacrificed, and the heroes roll [Initiative] to try to figure out what is up.

Start encounter.
