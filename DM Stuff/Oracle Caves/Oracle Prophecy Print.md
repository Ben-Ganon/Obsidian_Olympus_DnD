The moon child you have slain <br>
But the journey just begun  <br>
All of Greece will know great pain <br>
Unless the quest is won <br>

----------
On the isle of Thera<br>
Eternal Spring they hold<br>
Grand-child of Hera <br>
Has reaped fates untold<br>

----

The gates of Hades lie open <br>
The Heart of Thanatos awaits<br>
The Emperor she will awaken<br>
Greece will bleed if he escapes the fates<br>

---

On Crete you will find only tears and blood

Where the heart of a cult is silently forming

Over Greece they will pour over like a flood

Only a Hero can stop the cult from storming

--------

Who will remake the horned god's jail? <br>
Save Olympus from the fire and the hail <br>
A band of heroes, assembled before us<br>
Shall break or mend the horns of Tauros

---

The chorus sings praise <br>
For our heroes, fierce and brave<br>
Death lies in Hades<br>
