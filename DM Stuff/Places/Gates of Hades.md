# The Gates of Hades

- The gates of Hades are hard to find, since they keep moving all around Greece
- They usually spawn near a river, lake, or stream
- The only ones who would know where it's going to spawn next would be either priests of Hades or his children, someone with a deep connection to the underworld
- The Priests of Hades 
- At the Gates, the players find a scroll under a rock next to the entrance:
  "To whoever finds this.
  I hope it's you Lysander.
  If you found this, it means I am still inside Hades looking for Minos in Tartarus. 
  Don't close the Gates."
