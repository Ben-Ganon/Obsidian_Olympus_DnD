The Agoge is where children come to die so they can be reborn as not men, but Spartan warriors.
In the Agoge, boys are split into groups of twenty boys, each one in charge of it's own survival.

If they wish to eat, they must hunt and steal.
If they wish to sleep, they must make beds, and guard themselves from the terrors of night.
If they wish to fight, they may do so any time, so long as they win.

Each group forms a squad, and that squad is then maintained through the Agoge and into the Spartan army.
