The man below him was bleeding from a gash in his head.
He himself seemed fine, except for his bloody fists.
Where am I? 
Herakles, son of Hera, has found himself in [[The Pit]].
How did he get here? 
Ah yes, now he remembers.
Aphrodite possessed his girlfriend Helene. It was all downhill from there.
But why? it almost killed her, and the mad love goddess seemed to gain nothing from it.
Even though it brought them great suffering, he did get one thread to tug at - a voice, different from Aphrodite or Helena, said to find Amara. 
Who was she? how could she help him?

So off to Athens he went, starting his search for the mysterious Hero.

But alas, no hero's journey is easy: 
As he left his home of Pylos, he had to cross the battle lines from Spartan to Athenian territory.
And war being war, he was captured by a Spartan slaver and sold to a Spartan warrior by the name of Daikos, to serve as a punching bag for some of his squad mates.
Lucky for Herakles, being a demigod comes with some perks.
