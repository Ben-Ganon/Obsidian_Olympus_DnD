The man below him was bleeding from a gash in his head.
He himself seemed fine, except for his bloody fists.
Where am I? 
Herakles, son of Hera, has found himself in [[The Pit]].
How did he get here? 
Ah yes, now he remembers.
Aphrodite possessed his girlfriend Helene. It was all downhill from there.
But why? it almost killed her, and the mad love goddess seemed to gain nothing from it.
Even though it brought them great suffering, he did get one thread to tug at - a voice, different from Aphrodite or Helena, said to find Amara. 
Who was she? how could she help him?

And so Helena and Herakles ran away from home and started their journey to Athens, hoping this Amara could help them understand.

But alas, no hero's journey is easy: 
As they left Pylos, they had to cross the battle lines from Spartan to Athenian territory.
And war being war, they were captured by a Spartan slaver and sold to a Spartan warrior by the name of Daikos.
Herakles, to serve as a punching bag for some of his squad mates,
and Helena, to serve his wife.
Lucky for Herakles, being a demigod comes with some perks.
Unluckily for Helena, Aphrodite was not done with her. 
Daikos fell in love with Helena, and in his wife decided to punish him by publicly executing Helena in Sparta's agora.  
Herakles, fueled by rage and sorrow, defeated any Spartan Daikos would throw at him.
Finally done with all this shame, Daikos sent Herakles to [[The Pit]], hoping he would die.
But Herakles has no plan to die. Instead, Herakles will win the tournament, go to Hades, and drag Helena back no matter what it takes.
