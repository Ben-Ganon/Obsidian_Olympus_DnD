The Pit is an ancient tradition in Sparta. 
The [[Gates of Hades]] are known to move about Greece, but it seems their favorite place is Sparta.
Every time they appears, Sparta devolves into a mix of festive joy and war-like mania as they build The Pit, a colosseum-like arena where all can come to fight, cheer, and rejoice.

Each squad in the city must send a representative to fight in The Pit.
The winner earns the chance to descend the Gates, steal a pomegranate from the dark gardens that grow in the underworld, and return a victorious hero to Sparta.
