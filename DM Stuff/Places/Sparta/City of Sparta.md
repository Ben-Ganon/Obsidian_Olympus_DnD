The city of Sparta is one of the most ancient city-states in all of Greece, second in it's antiquity and pride only to Athens.
Legend has it that the original founder of Sparta was the sone of Zeus.
In accordance to it's age, Sparta comes with an intense legacy and an even greater pride that emanates from it.
Seated on the Eurotas river, Spartan citizens are accustomed to harsh conditions from birth in the [[Agoge]].   

Strength is central to the Spartan culture, and anyone who refuses to adhere to strength is cast out, killed, our enslaved.
Spartans believe all things you have must be earned - the only thing Sparta gives freely is blood.

Only fifty years after the last stand of the 300 warriors in Thermopylae, the Spartans are still considered the best land warriors in Greece.
It is said each Spartan warrior is worth ten Athenians in battle.


## The Four Tenants of Spartan Strength

> "It is said that Lacedaemon, the founder of Sparta and son of Zeus has four faces: 
One has red eyes, never blinking, from which he sees futures yet to come. 
One has a large mouth, with teeth as sharp as knives, so that he may bite down on his enemies.
One is always shifting, swirling his features in blood and skin and flesh, so he can never be truly seen.
And the last cries a river of blood, for he has lost many sons to war."

### Vision - חזון

Vision is the ability to glimpse into one future, and drag it by it's hair towards you.
Kings of Sparta rely on Vision to steer it to victory.

### Might - עוצמה

Might is the ability to overpower. Simple. Reliable.
Warriors of Sparta use Might to overpower their enemies in combat.
