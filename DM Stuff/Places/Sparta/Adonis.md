> "My mother taught me that the best way to entertain a crowd is to give it tragedy. If only she could see these young men fighting and dying for Sparta"


Adonis is the son of Apollo, a spartan warrior that announces for the various fighting rings around the city.
Cunning, strong, and most importantly charismatic, Adonis is a warrior of Guile.
His time in the Agoge taught him cunning and strength but most importantly it taught him to control others. 
Adonis had no problems convincing the other children in the Agoge to fight, steal, or even kill for him.
Over time, Adonis developed a taste for crowds, his specialty being whipping them up to a frenzy.
Many Spartans dismiss his talents as folly, they call him weak.
But one man saw his potential - Petros. 
Petros sent him with various generals to the front line, and Adonis would give a grand speech before important battles.
The warriors always seemed to have a glow to them after Adonis finished talking, and their enthusiasm carried over to win them many a war. 
His powers from Apollo are varied and subtle, allowing him to be heard from anywhere in the ring, and giving him an unnatural ability to persuade and deceive.
As well, he can induce frenzy in a crowd or group, inducing a violent mania.
There is nothing Adonis enjoys more than creating drama and tragedy in the ring, stirring the crowd to roars as one man beats another, then joy as they embrace. Or sorrow as one kills the other.
