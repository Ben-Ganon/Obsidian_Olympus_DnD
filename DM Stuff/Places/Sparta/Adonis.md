Adonis is the son of Apollo, a spartan warrior that announces for the various fighting rings around the city.
Cunning, strong, and most importantly charismatic, Adonis is a warrior of Guile.
His time in the Agoge taught him cunning and strength but most importantly it taught him to control others. 
Adonis had no problems convincing the other children in the Agoge to fight, steal, or even kill for him.
Over time, Adonis developed a taste for crowds, his specialty being whipping them up to a frenzy.
Many Spartans dismiss his talents as folly, they call him weak.
But one man saw his potential - Areos
His powers from Apollo are varied and subtle, allowing him to be heard from anywhere in the ring, and giving him an unnatural ability to persuade and deceive.
