Thalassios

# Backstory:

## Early Life and Origins:

Thalassios was born from the union of **Aphrodite**, the goddess of love, and a Nymph pirate named **Ashdod Ben Goliath**, who ruled the eastern Mediterranean. His father, Ashdod, a sea Nymph, led a band of seafaring who roamed the waters of the eastern Mediterranean, engaging in piracy not merely for plunder but to protect the sacred waters. Thalassios was born in Petra Aphrodite (rock of Aphrodite in Cyprus) and was given to Ashdod who knew that the child’s divine heritage made him a target for both mortal and divine enemies.

When Thalassios was just six years old, a powerful deity (**you can choose** whom, can be any) discovered his existence. They sought to capture or kill him, seeing him as valuable pawn to strength their power. In a desperate bid to protect his son, Ashdod arranged for him to be taken to Athens, a city where he could be hidden among the mortals. Entrusting the boy to a loyal contact in Athens, **Lykos Argyris**, his father believed this would be the safest place for him.

However, Lykos, as a merchant that trade ban goods, eventually saw an opportunity to profit from the child’s divine lineage. Thalassios was sold to **Elissa Panagos**, the main priestess of Aphrodite in Athens. Elissa, recognizing the boy’s potential, decided to raise him as her protégé, grooming him to be a tool in her quest for power and influence over the city.

## Life in Athens:

Thalassios grew up under the careful, yet manipulative, tutelage of Elissa Panagos. She saw in him not just a child to be nurtured, but a means to enhance her own power and control over Athens. From a young age, Thalassios was trained in the arts of persuasion, seduction, and manipulation. Elissa showered him with praise and affection, but these were tools she wielded to create a deep dependency. She made him believe that without her, he was nothing—his worth tied entirely to her desires and approval.

As Thalassios matured, his beauty, charm, and discretion made him renowned among Athens’s elite. But it was Elissa’s word to **Lysander Hasapis**, a powerful and dangerous politician, that sealed his fate. Lysander, holding the title of Archon Strategos, used Thalassios as a “party pet,” parading him at his lavish gatherings to impress and manipulate his guests. Thalassios’s role extended beyond mere physical presence; he became a skilled courtesan, fulfilling the deepest desires of Athens’s elite, whether through physical pleasure, role-playing, storytelling, or emotional intimacy. When he got more and more renown as his services started to came with a unique price—secrets. Thalassios demanded a secret from each patron, the significance of which determined the satisfaction he provided.

For, gaining more wealth, power, and influence was the key. 

## The Dark Relationship with Elissa:

The relationship between Thalassios and Elissa was marked by dark manipulation and twisted affection. Elissa’s love was a poison, designed to create dependence and reinforce loyalty. She molded Thalassios’s sense of self around her approval, making him believe that his very existence was tied to her desires. Over time, Thalassios developed a perverse form of devotion to her, loving her not despite her cruelty but because of it. This love eroded his self-worth and agency, binding him more tightly to her will.

**Elissa also twisted the blessings of Aphrodite into curses that further bound Thalassios to her. Each boon he received came at a cost—power that tightened the metaphysical chains around his soul. Elissa forced Thalassios into blood oaths, dark rituals that tied his life force to hers, making defiance or escape impossible without risking his own life or soul. (What do you think on this idea?)**

She employed psychological torture, planting doubts about reality and orchestrating betrayals to create paranoia and isolation. Her manipulation eroded Thalassios’s sense of reality, making him increasingly dependent on her. Elissa used his emotions as weapons, forcing him to hurt those he cared about to please her, deepening his self-loathing and reinforcing her control.

The darkness within Thalassios grew as Elissa planted seeds of corruption in his soul. These seeds fed on the fear, pain, and desires of those around him, pushing him towards cruelty and manipulation. The relationship was on a collision course with a dark end, as Thalassios’s resentment towards Elissa grew. He realized the monstrous thing he was becoming and knew that his final act of rebellion might be the only way to reclaim his soul, even if it meant his own destruction.

# Thalassios and Elissa Events:

From a young age, Elissa isolated Thalassios from anyone who might influence him in ways she didn’t control. She used affection as a reward system. Whenever Thalassios pleased her or succeeded in a task, she showered him with praise and affection. Conversely, when he failed or displeased her, she withdrew all warmth, leaving him in emotional coldness.

Elissa twisted the teachings of Aphrodite to suit her purposes. While Aphrodite is the goddess of love, Elissa focused on the aspects of manipulation, seduction, and control. She orchestrated situations where he would be betrayed by those he trusted (often manipulated by her) to reinforce the idea that only she was truly reliable.

Thalassios was trained to maintain perfect control over his emotions and physical appearance at all times. Elissa ensured that he could mask his true feelings, endure physical and emotional pain without breaking, and present a façade that suited whatever situation he was in.

Elissa controlled when and how Thalassios was exposed to the world outside the temple. She chose who he met and what he learned, ensuring that his worldview was shaped by her narratives. This limited exposure made Thalassios naive in some ways, completely reliant on Elissa for guidance.

She made Thalassios believe that he owed his very existence to her, twisting his love for her into something perverse.

## The Night of Betrayal:

Elissa’s orchestrated a situation that forced Thalassios to betray someone he cared about deeply—a young acolyte of Aphrodite, **Chara**, who had shown him kindness in a world devoid of it. Elissa, seeing the growing bond between Thalassios and this person, manipulated events so that Thalassios was led to believe that the only way to protect them from a fabricated threat was to turn them over to Elissa, who promised to "handle" the situation.
