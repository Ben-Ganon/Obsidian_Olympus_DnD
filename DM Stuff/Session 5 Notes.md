- The party has received the true prophecy from the oracle
- they venture out towards Thera, and then Knossos in Crete
- On the way, They will stop in Athens
- On the way to Athens, on the outskirts of the city, they meet the farmer Heraklion, with a man next to him
	- Heraklion says he's fine and everything is ok
	- The man next to him chortles "yeah, we're all good here, move on"
	- [On success intuition] PC's notice the man's arm is behind Heraklion's back
	  and they both seem tense
-  In the house, they can hear a struggle 
- The party can hear from the first floor the cultists chant "Blood and flesh, sate your hunger" "דם אדם יעיר קרניים, נשימה אחרונה תמית שמים"
- On the upper floor they can see through a crack in the door a woman, tied up with two cultists about to sacrifice her
	- (Larissa, Heraklion's wife)
	- The cultists are dressed in brownish red togas, that seem to sparkle - almost as if they are soaked in blood
	- Dressed in masks with an enhanced bull-like snout and horns
	- Underneath her a circle sprawled on the floor around her drawn in blood
	- Every time the cultists chant,  the markings explode with bright red light
- When they arrive at Athens,  they happen to find Theodore
	- He tells them the city has descended to chaos now that Lysander has taken over the council
	- He tells them the Cult has taken over most of the formal offices
	- Lysander ordered his cult followers to loot the Olympian temples and bring the spoils back to his palace
	- Says Penelope hasn't been seen since the Cult sacked the Parthenos, she might be in Lysander's palace
	- Knows a good place to hide - takes them to a slave hideout near the palace
	- Theodore offers them all wine and drink
	- Betrayal! Theodore is working with Lysander - the hideout is a trap for the party
- The party passes out from the tainted wine and wake up in the cellar of Lysanders palace
- Penelope is chained up with them - she seems in rough shape
- Lysander villain speech - 
	- Mad that they killed his lieutenant hector - he had a part of the key!! Selene specifically said if the key was to be lost it's his head 
	- No matter, Lysander would still like them to join him - 
		- Tragic backstory

		- They worship a different god
		- Perhaps this god will be better - so Aphelios says
- Let's them think about it for the night
