Now how does this work?

So!  Any time your party travels from one point to another, there will be a series of rolls made on the “Random Exploration Events Table” (a REET Roll if you will).  Taking turns, each time a REET roll is called for, a new player (who hasn’t yet rolled) will roll 1d6 and their roll will determine the outcome of what events take place during this next segment of the adventure.

This can not only be done while travelling across the world map, but also within deep sprawling dungeons, flying in an airship through the skies or simply when travelling anywhere outside of the confines of civilization.  

This table is designed to aid and inspire the DM as well as encourage collaborative storytelling at the table, allowing all players to pitch in to help describe the events taking place, together as a team.

# Event Rolls

As players travel through your world, you will need to decide if you will be using hex tiles on your map or if you wish to go for a more “loosey goosey” approach.  Will you have your travel go by day by day, or week by week?  How long does it take players to travel from hex to hex or place to place.  

For those looking to create less of a hex crawl experience, and more of a theatre of the mind narrative,  try to determine if the new location your players are travelling to is either  Near, Far or Far Far Away.  

Next decide how many random events you think would be appropriate for each instance of “obscure distance”.  My advice would be:

Near: 1-2 events

Far: 3-5 events

Far Far Away: 5-10 events

As for hex crawlers, I suggest having your players roll for a random event, once per hex.

But what do I mean by “rolling for random events”?

So each time the party must make a “REET Roll” (Rolling on the Random Exploration Event Table), the DM chooses a player who has not yet made a REET Roll yet, and that player rolls 1d6.  The DM then looks at the Random Exploration Events Table below and lets the party know what event occurs during this stage of the journey.  

How to run each event will be described in further detail below, but I encourage you as a DM to collaborate each time with the player who made the REET roll, to describe together the events that take place, how they happened etc.

When a new REET roll must be made, a new player who has not rolled should roll on the table.  Once everyone has had the opportunity to roll, return to the first player to have rolled and continue in that same order.

## Random Exploration Events Table

| 3          | Landmark                |

## Random Combat Encounter

The D&D Community is littered with Random Encounter Tables and so I will not be adding to those masses here.  However, I will be giving you some advice to improve your random encounters.

### Collaborative Storytelling

When a player rolls on the “Random Exploration Events Table” and ends up getting the “Random Combat Encounter” event, have that player be the one in the party who accidentally (or intentionally) triggers this event.  

Let your player choose if they triggered this event “provocatively” (i.e. did something stupid, selfish etc to trigger this event.  Example: They were throwing rocks into a pond and ended up hitting and angering a giant hippo) or if they triggered this event “passively” (i.e. they were simply walking through a dungeon and accidentally walked into a gelatinous cube).

If the player chooses to have triggered the event “provocatively”, the rest of the party will have the surprised condition at the start of combat.

If the player chooses to have triggered the event “passively”, that player will have the surprised condition at the start of combat.  

Keep in mind though that the player who triggered this encounter will Always be the one closest to danger when this encounter begins.

Explain to the player who rolled on the event table, what threat has emerged, but allow THEM to describe exactly how they got everyone into this mess.  Try to make this event a collaborative storytelling experience before the combat actually starts.

### Make it Relevant

Secondly, as easy as premade random encounters are to use.  I would advise writing up a small list of your own, containing Relevant possible encounters that would further enrich the overall themes and story of your campaign.  This is the main reason why I am not providing my own random encounter lists here, as I believe only YOU as a DM will know exactly what Your Campaign will need.  

Try not to have irrelevant encounters, but instead, have every possible combat scenario provide new information about the overall plot.  Have minions of your BBEG catch up to the players or creatures warped by wild magical surges from some plot related device, lash out and attack the party in confusion.  Consider having old foes return seeking vengeance or betrayed lovers send mercenaries to seek out and kill one player in particular.  Consider your players and their backstories.  Use this moment to further enrich their narratives, as well as your own.

But if you ARE stuck, here is an example of a random encounter table I designed for my players who were travelling from lush woodlands, up into the mountains and then through deserts until they reached a pirate city called Balegreen.

In this party there was a witch who communed with spirits,  a spirit or yokai who was battling with a corruption called “The Red”, a buff goliath called Krelos who was trying to find his place in the world, and a changeling doctor whose parents ran away from the Feywild years ago.  They lived in my homebrew world of Gostar but this campaign was set thousands of years in the past from the current timeline, where only a few hundred years ago, a great magical war almost brought mortalkind into extinction.  This is now a world filled with great spirits (yokai) and remnants of an advanced technology from ages past.

And so I tried to design a table that would include party relevant encounters as well as encounters filled with tid bits of lore.  Here is what I came up with:


| 1d10 Result | Combat Encounter                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1           | Iris vs Krelos (One of the player’s rivals would show up for a promised duel)                                                                                                                       |
| 2           | Purple Worm (If in the desert) / Roc (if in the mountains or woods)                                                                                                                                 |
| 3           | Old forgotten shrine, inhabited by an oni/demon (starved of prayers so dried out and looks like a wrinkled leather/wooden statue) praying to it will reawaken it, in a weakened form.               |
| 4           | Stone Guardian (guarding a god’s abandoned temple)                                                                                                                                                  |
| 5           | The Red (A prominent omnipotent evil in this campaign)                                                                                                                                              |
| 6           | Sand/Lake Siren:  Lure party into a bottomless… Lake/Oasis/Sea (leads to the plane of water) / Quicksand.  The Siren will be attached to the lure of a giant Anglerfish (use stat block of a Oblex) |
| 7           | Old war robot (like in Zelda BOTW) reactivates: Arcane Turret/ Flamethrower / Force Ballista                                                                                                        |
| 8           | Old spirits of fallen warriors (4-6 shadows)                                                                                                                                                        |
| 9           | Changeling cousins of Viola show up to kidnap her.  (Will disguise themselves as other teammates, lure them away so they can get Viola on her own).                                                 |
| 10          | Tooth Fairies + pixies + 1 faerie dragon mounted by a Will-O-Wisp (sent to locate Viola).                                                                                                           |

## Weather

When a weather event takes place, refer to my “Horrible Weather Effects” PDF found [here (Free Version](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.patreon.com/posts/free-sample-104356945?utm_medium%3Dclipboard_copy%26utm_source%3DcopyLink%26utm_campaign%3Dpostshare_creator%26utm_content%3Djoin_link&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1727369328115520&usg=AOvVaw36RAVl-Vep5WM2nFQ4-f9l)) or [here ($3 Full PDF)](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.patreon.com/TheUglyGoblin/shop/ugly-goblins-horrible-weather-effects-232955?utm_medium%3Dclipboard_copy%26utm_source%3DcopyLink%26utm_campaign%3Dproductshare_fan%26utm_content%3Djoin_link&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1727369328115836&usg=AOvVaw2MFQlyhnWS2iIn6jPDDUkm).  Within this document is a collection of weather effects that all suit different terrains and environments.  As a DM, pick a weather effect that best suits the environment your players are in, and consider having it last for the next 1d4 segments of travel, with the intensity ramping up each time (if you are using the full PDF).

If using the “Grittier Survival” rules, consider having your party have disadvantage on their survival checks or even ramping up the DC by a number equal to twice the storm’s level.  Forcing them to take shelter.  For every day spent in shelter, have the party use up 1 of their rations, and roll 1d20 to see if the storm stays or passes over them each day; with the storm passing on an 11 or higher.  

## Landmark

Every now and then we just want to see something cool as we travel through the world.  Below is a collection of tables that you can roll on to aid you in describing different landmarks that your party encounters while travelling through the wilds.

If you like this table though I would also strongly recommend you check out Sly Flourish’s [“The Lazy DM’s Workbook”](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://shop.slyflourish.com/products/the-lazy-dms-workbook?srsltid%3DAfmBOoo9opSwcnARj35MKcMMLrYAtYynCslQu-m_piVUlQf_yjxu0mrq&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1727369328116287&usg=AOvVaw3baoz1_g6TygfIoD1080ZA) which includes tons of tables like this.  The most relevant being their “Random Monuments” tables on page 12.

As for my own, choose one of the table pairs that best suit the landscape the party is currently travelling through and then roll 1d6 for each table and combine the results so you have a nice mote of inspiration to draw from when describing this new location to your players.

## Social Encounter

This is your time to pull out those NPCs from players' backstories, defeated villains who were left for dead, silly shopkeeps, or individuals who have been wronged by the party.  

If you can’t think of something, consider asking the player who rolled: “who do you want to see show up in this segment? Who do you stumble across?”

This could also be a spirit of a loved one, returning from the grave to have but a moment with the party or an individual player.  Who said anything about the social event needing to be with living characters.

Alternatively, consider asking the player who rolled: “Is there anyone in the Party you wish to spend some time with?”  

And if no one can think of anything, here is a fun little travelling merchant your party can always stumble upon out in the wilderness…

###   
Omamori

…is a choldrith who pulls along a small cart behind him with a purple tent attached to it.  If a creature steps inside it is far larger on the inside, willed with potions and “spell tags” both wooden and paper, all strung up in webs.  Omamori is a creature of little words but is a master alchemist who also specialises in the fabricating of spell tags.  These spell tags work the same way as spell scrolls but can typically be used by anyone, regardless of their arcane affinity.

How he always appears regardless of the party’s location is a mystery.  All we know is that Omamori will never pass up on the opportunity to sell their wares to someone who’s willing to pay full price, due to their desperate situation.

## Found Materials

While exploring through the wilderness, the party may occasionally stumble across handy materials on their journey.  These may be scavenged from the body of a dead monster the party stumbles across, or perhaps they just get lucky and find a rich ore vein or lush grove.  Either way, when the party rolls on this event, as a DM you can ask the player who rolled, if they found a dead creature, grove or ore vein.  Or if you prefer, you can choose whichever is the most relevant for your story.

In any case, that player can then roll 1d4+1 and gain that much whatever material they found.  See “Gathering” below for more information.  In this case the party members roll their survival, nature or investigation check but cannot roll lower than a 10.  In the case of making attack rolls for hunting, this is still made by one of the players, but it is done so with advantage.

Alternatively, the players could find materials from a creature listed in my [“Smithing in D&D: The Ugly Goblin’s Blueprints”](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://docs.google.com/document/d/12s3286zgFSIMZHb1gzS1YfBhq_iwVjRzt7_VJGk12hs/edit?usp%3Dsharing&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1727369328136748&usg=AOvVaw1Kp3EWA41H_lxvgtxSlI1C) document.  Roll 1d12 to decide on the type of creature they find and have them find a creature whose CR is close to that of the party’s level.  This creature would already be dead and each party member can salvage 1 material from it.

## Player Driven Narrative

This, in my experience, is where some of the most fun can be had while travelling through the world.  When a player rolls on a “Player Driven Narrative” event, pass on your DM hat to that player and ask them: “What is a significant event that happens during this segment of the journey?”

Obviously it should be something within reason like a beach day, star gazing or maybe the party finds a bunch of hot springs.  But this is a moment I can guarantee your players will be excited about because what happens next is something They want.  It’s not always easy as a DM to know what your players want out of a game, so every now and then it's nice to just let them guide the story for a little bit.

If ever the player is stuck, feel free to let them use anything within this document to also help inspire their decision.

# Gathering

Once per day a player may choose to search for materials in the wild, should the environment be suitable enough to do so. This process is called “gathering” and when a player chooses to “gather”, they specify if they wish to Mine, Hunt or Forage. This will determine the types of materials they will end up finding.  When gathering, a player makes a skill check using their choice of either investigation, nature or survival to look for materials.  What they roll will determine the rarity of the material they find (see Mining, Hunting and Foraging for more details on each).  In most cases, unless otherwise specified, on a successful “gathering” roll, a player will find a single material.  Example: If they mine, they will find 1 collection of ore, if they hunt they will find 1 creature part, and if they forage they will find 1 plant or natural material.

In the case of travelling across large distances, do not have players “gather” every day of travel, instead, allow them to gather once per hex on the map they are travelling on, or once per “Event Roll”, when they make a successful gathering roll in this way, allow them to gather 1d4+1 of that material.  

## Mining

When mining, need to be in an area appropriate for mining.  Once per day, if in an appropriate area, can make a survival, nature or investigation check.  Based on that check a player may find one of the following types of materials.  

Simple ores need a DC 12 to find

Precious ores need a DC15 to find

magical Ores need a DC 20 to find

After referencing the list of ore types above, roll 1d6  on the appropriate table below to see what ore you find.  A single ore vein holds 1 lump of unrefined ore.  On a natural 20, the vein contains 1d4+1 lumps of unrefined ore.  It takes 1 hour of mining to extract 1 lump of unrefined ore.  Or in the case of a natural 20, they extract all lumps within the hour.

### Common Ores

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
|1d6 Result|Ore Found|Benefits|
|1|Ingredients for making steel|Nothing noteworthy|
|2|Ingredients for making bronze|Weapons made with bronze gain the heavy weapon property.  If it has the light property it does not gain the heavy property but instead loses the light property.  Armour made with bronze reduces incoming non magical damage by 2, but reduces movement speed by 10ft to and grants disadvantage on acrobatics checks.|
|3|Quicksilver|Grants the light property to weapons.  Weapons made with this which would have the two handed property, do not have the weapon property and instead gain the versatile weapon property.  Weapons with this property, when wielded with one hand, use damage dice one category smaller. Eg. A great axe (1d12) would use 1d10, and a greatsword (2d6) would use 2d4.  Heavy Armour made with this ore looses the disadvantages I grants the wielder but grants 1 less bonus to AC.|
|4|Moonstone|Weapons made with this ore grant the wielder a +1 to attack and damage rolls when wielded in moonlight.  And armour made with this ore grants the wearer a +1 bonus to AC while the armour is exposed to moonlight.|
|5|Lead|Weapons made with this ore lose the light or versatile property when made (versatile weapons must be wielded with two hands, and use the higher of the two dice).  Additionally, any creatures that are dealt damage with this weapon must make a constitution saving throw (DC 8) or be poisoned.  Armour made with this weapon poisons the wearer so long as they are wearing it and reduces their movement speed by 10ft.  While poisoned in this way the wearer cannot see further than 40ft.  However, while wearing this armour, the wearer gains advantage on saving throws against magical effects.|
|6|Copper|Can be refined into 10 copper pieces.  Cannot be used to form weapons or armours.|

### Precious Ores

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
|1D6 Result|Ore type|Benefits|
|1-2|Silver|Can be refined into 10 silver pieces|
|3|Electrum|Can be refined into 5 electrum pieces|
|4|Gold|Can be refined into 5 gold pieces|
|5|Platinum|Can be refined into 2 platinum pieces|
|6|Star Platinum|Worth the same as platinum but can also be forged into weapons and armour.  Star platinum has all the same properties as mithril but can grant weapons made from it a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls, and can store a single spell of 5th level or lower.  Stored spells can be used as an action while wielding the item holding said spell.|

### Magical Ores

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
|1D6 result|Ore Type|Benefits|
|1|Demonite|Any creature in contact with this ore cannot teleport, turn invisible, become ethereal or change their shape in any way.  If bound by this refined metal one must make a DC 25 strength check in order to escape.|
|2|Radionite|This ore emits bright light in a 10ft radius and dim light for an additional 10ft.  When a weapon made with radionite, successfully hits a creature, that creature must make a constitution saving throw (Dc12) or be blinded until the end of their next turn.  Armour made with radionite grants the effects of the bless spell.|
|3|Chaos Ore|When this ore is refined, roll on the Chaos Ore table* below.  This refined ore then becomes associated with that damage type.  Weapons made with chaos ore grant an additional 1d4 of that damage type.  Armour made with this ore reduced incoming damage, of its associated damage type by 5.|
|4|Blackrock|Blackrock is a material devoid of colour and it does not reflect light, so seemingly appears as a black void.  This material is also said to retain memories of places it has been, allowing it to return there.  Weapons made with this weapon return to the wielder after being thrown or fired.  Armour made with this material grants the wearer a +5 bonus to stealth while they are in a dimly lit space, or a +10 bonus while in total darkness.  Any creature wielding a piece of Blackrock, or an item made from it can teleport as an action, to any space with 30ft of them that they have previously stood in within the past hour.  Once it allows a creature to do so, this Blackrock cannot grant that benefit again for 8 hours.|
|5|Whitestone|Whitestone drains living creatures of their magic and leaves nearby magical items devoid of magic.  If a creature starts its turn within 10ft of a piece of Whitestone, it loses 1 spell slot, starting with its highest available spell slot.  Or will lose 2d4 of mana.|
|6|Mithril|Weapons made with mithril reduce the number they need for a critical hit by 1.  Armour made with mithril renders the wearer immune to critical hits and grants their armour an additional +1 bonus to its AC as well as removing any disadvantages that armour grants.|

### Ore needed to forge items

All items require a certain amount of one ore to forge.

- Daggers and other weapons of a similar size or smaller, require 1 ore to make.
- Any weapon without the heavy or two-handed property requires 2 ore to make.
- Any weapon with the heavy or two-handed property requires 3 ore to make.
- Any light armour cannot be formed with ore and require materials from the hunting or foraging tables instead.
- Shields require 3 ore to make
- Any medium armour requires 4 ore to make.
- Any heavy armour requires 5 ore to make.

(Light armour requires 4 of any kind of “leather” piece to make.)

You must have the same type of ore to make an item.  You cannot make an item using ores of a different type.  This can only be done if using the smithing skill tree.  However,  you still need the required amount of ores to make that item.  For example, if using the smithing tree and making one refined material for a longsword using a creature part and then deciding to make additional refined materials using lead and Blackrock, would require you to have 2 pieces of lead ore AND 2 pieces of Blackrock in order to make each component.

## Hunting

When hunting, a player needs to be in an appropriate environment.  Once per day, if in an appropriate area, a player can make a survival, nature or investigation check.  Based on that check they may find one of the following types of creatures.  

Common Hunts need a DC 10 to find

Precious Hunts need a DC 13 to find

Mystical Hunts need a DC 18 to find

From here, the player must make an attack roll.  If they manage to beat the AC of that creature, they will successfully kill it and harvest it for materials.

After referencing the list of creature types above, roll 1d4 on the appropriate table below to see what creature you find.  Refer to the top of the table to see what that creature’s AC is (if applicable).  You will be able to salvage 1 material from that creature.  If you roll a critical hit on your attack roll, you find twice that amount.  It takes 1 hour of hunting to find this creature, slay it and harvest material’s from it.

### Common Hunts

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
|1d4 Result|Creature Found (No attack roll required)|Benefits|
|1|Owlbear Egg|This egg can feed a party of 4-5 for up to 1 day.  (Counts as 1 hearty ration per person).  Eating this egg raw grants a +2 bonus to strength checks for the day.|
|2|Rainbow Carp|This giant carp can feed a party of 4-5 for 1 day. (Counts as 1 basic ration per person).  Consuming this fish grants a +2 to intelligence checks for the day.|
|3|Harpie Hare|This winged hare can feed a party of 4-5 for 1 day. (Counts as 1 basic ration per person).  Consuming this hare grants a +2 to dexterity checks for the day.|
|4|Hearty Boar|This juicy fat rich board can feed a party of 4-5 for 3 days. (Counts as 3 hearty rations per person).  Consuming this boar grants a +2 to constitution checks for the day.  Can also be skinned to make 1 leather piece.|

### Precious Hunts

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
|1D4 Result|Creature Found (AC 13)|Benefits|
|1|Gemback|This jewel encrusted armadillo-like creature proves to be a formidable game for hunters, but the spoils are worth it.  Its tough gamey flesh can feed a party of 4-5 for 3 days. (Counts as 3 basic rations per person), but it provides no benefits.  However, upon slaying it, a player will find 1d4 salvageable precious gemstones, worth (1d6 x 5) gold a piece.|
|2|Gold Fleeced Goat|These large goats have a thick fluffy hide made of gold fibres. Its tough gamey flesh can feed a party of 4-5 for 2 days. (Counts as 2 hearty rations per person), but it provides no benefits.  However, upon slaying it, a player can sheet it to earn 1d4 x 10 gold worth of fleece.<br><br>One can also salvage 1 “golden leather piece” from this creature.  Armour made with 4 golden leather pieces grants the wearer a +3 bonus to charisma checks.|
|3|Arcane Angler|These rare but horrific looking fish serve as a prime source of mana replenishments for all casters.  This fish can feed a party of 4-5 for 1 day. (Counts as 1 basic ration per person), and upon consuming it, a caster will regain their highest level spell slot (no higher than 3rd level), or 5 mana.  Alternatively, 1 ration made into a pulp and mixed with alcohol.  If a magic item is soaked in this liquid for 1 hour, it regains 1d4+2 charges.  Wizards will happily purchase one of these anglers for 100 gold a piece.|
|4|Sheepwolf|These rare wolves have the ability to magically disguise themselves as a sheep.  This creature’s blood can be drained and mixed with vinegar to make a polymorph potion.  The meat then provides enough food to  feed a party of 4-5 for 2 days.  (Counts as 2 hearty rations per person).  Any nearby farms will happily pay you 10 gold pieces for its head, to ward off other sheepwolves out there.<br><br>One can also salvage 1 “shifting leather piece”.  A piece of armour made with 4 pieces of shifting leather can grant the benefits of the disguise self spell once per day|

| 2          | Ancient Phoenix (Ash)              | Upon killing this phoenix, it bursts into ash from which a new phoenix will be born.  But syphoning a little of the ash for yourself couldn’t hurt.  This ash can be used to cast revivify as an action without consuming a spell slot or needing material components.  Alternatively it can be sold to any holy figure for 500 gold pieces.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

| 4          | Dying Kirin (Horn)                 | At the end of its life, a Kirin seeks to be killed by a skilled hunter.  If killed, its body explodes, leaving behind a spectral horn.  This horn is priceless and whoever has it in their possession will draw in the interest of many desperate individuals.  This horn can be used to cast true resurrection, but requires a willing living creature to offer their life in exchange for the life being resurrected.                                                                                                                                                                                              |

## Forage

When foraging, a player needs to be in an area appropriate for foraging.  Once per day, if in an appropriate area, a player can make a survival, nature or investigation check.  Based on that check they may find one of the following types of materials.  

Simple Plants need a DC 12 to find

Precious Plants need a DC15 to find

Mystical Plants need a DC 20 to find

After referencing the list of material types above, roll 1d4  on the appropriate table below to see what plant you find.  Refer to the table to see how much of this plant you find.  On a natural 20, you find twice that amount.  It takes 1 hour of foraging to find these plants.

| 1          | Aid Leaf                  | A core ingredient for brewing the common healing potion. This dry leaf can be consumed or applied to open wounds as an action to aid in the healing process.  Doing so restores 1d4 hit points, but if you consume too many in a day (more than your CON mod) you will become poisoned until you take a long rest.                                                     |
| 2          | Bluecap                   | This core ingredient for brewing the common healing potion is deadly when eaten raw.  Consuming this odourless and flavourless blue mushroom will deal 1d4 poison damage to whoever costumes one of these.                                                                                                                                                             |
| 3          | Assassin's Step           | This silky moss can be used to pad armour or line the inside of one’s shoes.  The sound absorbing properties remove any disadvantage to stealth an armour might give, or in the latter case, grant the wearer a +3 bonus to stealth checks as it muffles their footsteps.  However, due to the brittle nature of this moss it can only grant this benefit for 8 hours. |
| 4          | Sunlily                   | Tapping these white flowers with a hard enough bonk causes them to emit light for up to 4 hours.  Miners often carry a bag full of these flowers, as torches can be unsafe at times.                                                                                                                                                                                   |

### Precious Plants

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
|1D4 Result|Plant found (1d4 of them)|Benefits|
|1|Crystal Bells|These tiny crystal flowers resemble a lily of the valley.  They sell for a fine price of 1 silver, but can also be crushed into a powder blown across a space, acting very similarly to the faerie fire spell.|
|2|Rusted Cone|Iron pine woods are quite the sight to come across.  Dozens of metallic trees bleed with rust.  These forests are traditionally farmed by dwarves who were lucky enough to find an iron pine tree bearing a rusted cone.  If ever you find one yourself, there’s always going to be a dwarf out there willing to purchase it for 50 gold or more.|
|3|Ruby/Sapphire/Topaz Rose|These crystal roses fetch a high price at any store, typically selling for 10 gold a piece.  Alternatively the can be thrown as an action, exploding to deal 2d6 fire/cold/lighting damage to a target, being consumed in the process.|
|4|Golden Fruit|A rare find!  These fruits will randomly grow from any plant that bears fruit.  The chances of it occurring are incredibly rare.  But if found, this fruit can sell for its weight in gold.  Alternatively it can be consumed to cure an individual of any poison or disease.|

### Mythical Plants

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
|1D4 result|Plant found (1 of them)|Benefits|
|1|Mandrake|Once harvested, one can immediately store them in a flask of oil to keep them silent.  Once removed from the earth or oil, the mandrake will let out a harsh scream after 10 seconds, forcing every creature that can hear within a 30ft radius to make a DC12 Constitution saving throw or be stunned until the end of their next turn.  On a success, the creature is still deafened for 1 minute.  The mandrake dies after releasing this scream and can be eaten like a root vegetable.|
|2|Litch’s Lichen|This bone white lichen lives on both the material and ethereal planes simultaneously.  Crushing such a plant up and inhaling it allows you to do the same for 1 minute.  During this time you can see into the ethereal plane, and can communicate with the dead.  Additionally, you become semi-incorporeal and take half damage from non-magical weapons.  <br><br>You cannot regain these benefits again until you take a long rest.|
|3|Heaven’s Grace|This frilled lace-like spectral gold flower is said to be able to cure any ailment.  Dissolving it in purified holy water will grant the benefits of the “greater restoration spell”, to whoever the water is poured over.|
|4|Dragon Heart|This rare, bulb-like plant emits a faint orange glow and a low beating can be heard from within.  Being forced to consume one of these within 10 seconds after dying will bring that creature back to life, so long as they have a heart.|

# Grittier Survival

For those of you looking for a much more gritty experience when travelling and exploring, I have a few additional rules you can add when using this document.

Start by making sure the party keeps track of how many rations they have.

There are 3 kinds of rations that can be purchased.

### Basic rations

These rations consist of dry foods suitable for extended travel, including jerky, dried fruit, hardtack, and nuts.  One purchase of these rations costs 5 silver pieces and is enough to feed 1 person per instance of travel (e.g. 1 hex or 1 distance of travel).

### Hearty Rations

These high quality rations consist of flat elven bread, salted meats along with fine cordials and preserves. One purchase of these rations costs 1 gold piece and is enough to feed 1 person per instance of travel (e.g. 1 hex or 1 distance of travel).  Anyone who consumes these rations gains 5 temporary hit points at the start of the next day, (after they finish a long rest).

### Luxurious Rations

These magically preserved foods have been enchanted to weigh less and take up less room when stored away in packs, and yet retain all of their freshness and nutrition.  These rations typically consist of freshly baked bread, marbled steaks, fresh fruit and vegetables along with some candies and warm pasties for morale.  One purchase of these rations costs 5 gold pieces and is enough to feed 1 person per instance of travel (e.g. 1 hex or 1 distance of travel).  Anyone who consumes these rations gains 10 temporary hit points at the start of the next day, (after they finish a long rest), and have advantage rolls made with one saving throw or skill check of their choice that day.

## Resource Management

Every time the party makes a REET roll, (travels through 1 hex or one instance of travel), each player uses up 1 ration.

Have one of your players make a survival check each time they roll on the event table (DC10).

If they fail the party becomes lost, do not progress and use up one of their resources/rations.

Any time the party rolls on the “Found Materials” event, each party member regains +1 basic ration.  Additionally, you can then let the party choose whether or not to roll for valuable resources (eg mining, foraging, hunting etc.) OR roll 1d6+1 to have each party member gain that many basic rations.

I think adding this mechanic alone will make survival that bit more fun and exciting.  If players try to simply eat goodberries for the whole trip or survive on “magically conjured food” have it take a psychological toll on them, permanently reducing their maximum hit points by 5 every time they rely on artificial food.  These lost hit points will be replenished the next day after eating a “real meal”
