Athens' slave master and general sadist, Gregor dominates the slave trade in the city with an iron fist.
Many times the council tried to temper him, and even abolish the practice altogether, but Gregor's influence and immense fortune has kept his business the most successful in the Delian League.
Brutal and imposing, Gregor is a serious problem for both the slaves and the people of the city.

He doubles as a jewelry seller in some of the markets close to the slave quarters.
