She was born defying the sacred oath of Artemis to eternal virginity, so Artemis forced her mother, a noble hunter from Crete, to abandon her in the forest to hide her shame.
Her mother later snuck back in secret to retrieve her, and passed her on to be raised in secret by some farmers.
He told them the story, and they in turn told her. In time, Selene grew bitter and angry at Artemis for forcing her mother to abandon her.
Even though her adoptive parents were loving and kind, Selene grew more bitter every day on the farm.
The farm work made her strong, hard, and most of all angry.
Angry at the world for leaving her for a life of work she thought below her.
Angry at her mother for being a coward.
Angry at Artemis for breaking her vow and abandoning her "shame".
When Aphelios met her on his journey to Crete and offered her to join him on his quest to raze Greece, she happily agreed.
She trained long and hard, and discovered she had a knack for knives and axes. 
She could also use a bow better than anyone in the cult. 
But whatever could be said about her ability to fight and kill, was nothing compared to her ability to become shadow.
Tuning in to her hunter mother, she can become one with her surroundings and disappear as easily as others might breath.
