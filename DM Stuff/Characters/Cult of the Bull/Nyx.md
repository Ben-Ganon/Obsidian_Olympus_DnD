Nyx, daughter of [[Hades]].
When Nyx was a young girl, she discovered she had an interest with animals, but only dead ones.
She could, without much effort, make a dead cat get up and walk around, if only for a short time.
This, expectedly, caused Nyx to be bullied severely by the children in her village, and she learned the only solace she would receive would be from her "pets".
Her mother, who refused to tell her who her father really was, sent her away in fear she would become like him.
Mad at her mother and the world around her, Nyx develops an intense hatred for humans, and seeks out some kind of place she could call home.
Nyx roamed Greece, only to find a small entrance to a cave on the island of Crete, which she followed.
Somehow, the monsters and many dangerous obstacles were no challenge to Nyx, and she passed, untouched, into Hades.
There, she met a man who resembled her so much, a dark spark much like hers shone in his eyes. She knew she met her father
Nyx never felt so at home. 
Over the months she spent in the realm of the underworld, Nyx fell in love with it all. Cerberus, the lost souls roaming asphodel, and especially the strange Thanatos, manifestation of Death itself.
They developed an intense relationship, leading her to truly feel like someone understood her for the first time in her life.
But all was not well.
Hades, seeing his daughter gain respect and power in his realm, grew jealous, and cast Nyx out from his realm.
As a parting gift, Thanatos gave Nyx [[The Black Key]], which could open a back door to hades, should she ever want to come back to the underworld to see him.
Heartbroken by the sudden loss, Nyx grew tired of this world, and set to take her life the next day, just to force her father to let her rejoin the underworld, if only in Asphodel. 
In a surprising twist of fate, just as Nyx emerged from the underworld, she met Aphelios, who promised her this world, and hades with it, could end for all.
Seeing this as a much better option, Nyx decided this was the best path for her - slay her father, ruin the underworld, and reunite with Thanatos.
