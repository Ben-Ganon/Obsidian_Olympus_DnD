![[Atlas.png |400]]
Atlas, son of [[Ares]].
Atlas was born in a quiet town on the Egyptian coast to a martial artist named Cassandra.
When Ares showed interest in her prowess, Cassandra thought it was the best thing that could have happened to her, and sparred with him happily.
She would lose every time, and for a while they were happy.
After her son was born, Cassandra went back to sparring and through some turn of the fates, she beat Ares.
In his shame, Ares could not contain this defeat to a woman he once loved, and as punishment he drove her insane.
She tried to kill her son, but was stopped last second by her mother, Eleni.
Eleni, with no options left, had to kill her daughter.
She named her grandson Atlas, as a small retribution to the god of war. She raised Atlas to hate Olympus. When he was of age Atlas, now the strongest man in his village, ventured out to find a way to avenge his mother. 
At first he found nothing but pain, so in a bid to stop the pain and the voices from Ares telling him terrible truths, he joined the war on Sparta's side.
After many battles, in which he slaughtered enemies by the dozens, he finally gave in to the voices.
in a particularly nasty battle, he butchered his own unit after seeing that no more enemies were left for him to kill.
When the terrible truth of his actions made it to his mind, Atlas went on the run to Crete.
When he met Aphelios, he knew he had found the man who could finally rid him of his voices. By killing the fucking god who sends them.
