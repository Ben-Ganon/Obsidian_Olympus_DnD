![[Hector Pantazis.png | 300]]
Son of Janus and second in command to [[Lysander Hasapis]].
Hector popped up on the scene of Athens rather recently, and has remained a mystery to all who speak with him.
He refuses to speak about his past, or about the giant scars on his face. 
The rumors say Janus gave him the scars as a second option to death for disgracing him with a botched ritual in his temple.
Now, he resides over the Janus temple in the underground catacombs of [[Athens]]
