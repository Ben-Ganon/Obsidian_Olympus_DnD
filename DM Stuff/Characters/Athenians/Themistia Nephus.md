Themistia Nephus is high priestess in the Parthenon in Athens and  [[Penelope Diakos]]' second in command. 
She is not a demigod, but she has a complicated relationship with the Gods.
As a priestess of Athena, she expected to be cunning, logical, and above all rational, at all times.
But it is hard to be the best when there will always be someone better than you at it - 
Especially when that special someone is born to [[Athena]].
Her ambition and natural smarts have brought her far, but she will always be second to Penelope.
She has a rough relationship with Penelope, as she both admires and envies her position. 
This frustration with the Gods for blessing some and not others has tinted her view of them, and now she slowly grows jaded in her position as second in command. 
Then comes [[Lysander Hasapis]], who she does not know is a demigod, and offers her a chance to get back at the gods - work with him to topple Penelope and win the Grand Priesthood for herself.

She gives him access to the sacred bull in the ceremony during [[Session 2 - A Dance with Fate]].
