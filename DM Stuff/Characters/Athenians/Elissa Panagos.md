Head Priestess of the Temple of [[Aphrodite]] in Athens.
A sly, cunning woman, she rose to be head of the temple not because of ambition and hard work, but due to her incredible beauty and intense magic given by Aphrodite as sort of a cruel game.
Elissa is not good at this whole 'managing a temple' thing. She is, however, excellent at manipulating people into going against their best interest. 
Her many disciples at the temple of Aphrodite answer her every beck and call, scared to death she will sell them to a slaver, spill all their secrets, or worse - disown them.
However great she as at weaving webs of spiraling agents, lies, and secrets to her benefit  - she has one great weakness, and that is booze. 
At parties, she can occasionally be seen seducing high level Athenian bureaucrats while so drunk she can barely string together words. Aphrodite's magic tends to kick in so she still manages, but a keen-eyed bystander  could observe both her seduction and her inebriation.
As [[Lysander Hasapis]] rose to power, he noticed her more and more. And where others would see a dangerous spider sitting in her web, Lysander saw a lamb ripe for slaughter.
During one party she was served an especially strong wine, some said it even glowed a godly purple as if it was blessed by Dionysus himself. 
Drinking it proved to be her demise. 
She could not remember their ill-fated conversation, Elissa could vaguely remember saying something she shouldn't. 
But for the life of her she could not remember what.
When a messenger came to deliver the scroll with Lysander's threat, she needed to find out if it was real or a ploy to gain more power. And to solve this particular problem she had just the tool - a young, promising acolyte named [[Thalssios]]. 
Meanwhile, she had to play along with Lysander, just in case he was telling truth.
He only wanted a simple favor anyway - using her powerful shimmer ability to disguise a young servant in his household as a young bull - how much bad could come of it?
