## Delphi Caves

### The Spiral
- As the Heroes descend into the caves in the tight black spiral, each hero is shown a vision:
	- Amara:
		- Amara finds herself suddenly in a golden field of wheat
		- She can sense that in this moment she is not Amara at all - she is simply seeing the world through another woman's eyes
		- She is waiting for someone
		- A strong, dark man with eyes shining in blue and green like a peacocks tail emerges from the tall stalks, looking lovingly at her:
		  "Helena, I cannot stay long. 
		  My father is looking for me - he wont be happy if he finds us together.
		  But know that If you wish, I will run away with you. I know we can be happy"
		- Amara can feel herself saying as the girl: "Herakles, please take me away!"
		- A sudden explosion of pink fog emerges between them
		- "Ah Ah Ah, no romance for Hera's special boy"
		- The fog attacks her, aiming to lodge itself in her throat. 
		- Amara realizes that is not a vision of the future or the past, but of the present - She can save this girl if she tries hard enough
		- What does she do?
	- Thalassios:
		- Thalassios is in a dark room.
		  He can feel heavy chains wrapped around him.
		  He is a monster unlike any other - a monster of lust and secrets.
		  A door opens, and through it - a beautiful blonde woman steps in.
		  He cannot seem to glean if this is Aphrodite or Elissa.
		  It does not matter - in this moment, they are the same to him - cruel mistresses using him for their own purposes.
		  The figure speaks "hello vile creature, I have a task for you."
		  She shoves a bound and gagged Chara at him "Kill."
		  What does Thalassios do?
	- Aeneas:
		- Aeneas is in a grand throne room, like none he has seen before
		- On the walls, beautiful paintings of bulls in reds and blacks
		- On a throne of Obsidian rests a young man in his late teens, clad in a dark hood 
		- Aeneas is looking up to him from another's body
		- It is Lysander
		- Aeneas can feel himself say "My liege, the Heroes have escaped me"
		- The man on the throne spits out "shame. You know I don't accept failure. Next time the Heroes escape you, 
		  I will add you to the list of sacrifices! what do you have to say for yourself"
		- In this moment, Aeneas feels godly power from Ares surging in him, and for just a moment Lysander's eyes glow red, and he seems oddly scared, a face he does not often make. 
		- What does Aeneas say to the stranger?
	- Orphea:
		- Orphea is on a hill overlooking a small village on the island of Corfu
		- In the distance, more villages pop up among the hills and valleys
		- Everything is burning
		- In the distance, screaming
		- Immediately below her, her town is being attacked
		- Does Orphea descend toward the town to try to protect them?
		- As she descends, her rage comes to be as fire - her skin is molten bronze, her eyes literally ablaze with fury
		- She encounters the first pillager - a tall man with the heads of three gorgons on his belt
		- Next, she encounters another pillager - but this time something is different.
			- Only a young boy, it seems he did not kill any gorgons and is horrified at what is happening around him.
			- He tries to stop another pillager from killing a gorgon child but cannot overcome him
			- What does Orphea do?
	- Theodore:
		- Theodore is atop mount Olympus
		- He asks himself "how did I get here?"
		- Suddenly the realization dawns on him all at once: he is holding Zeus.
		- His friends watch on as in one hand a massive sword is pointed at the king of Olympus, and in the other the king himself is beaten bloody
		- Nearby his friends are shackled, begging for him to stop, reconsider, join them again and just return to a peaceful life
		- Beside him, a young man, whispering in his ear "Do it, and I will grant you more power than you have ever dreamed of"
		- What does Theodore do?

### The Caverns
![[Oracle Caves.png | 400]]
In front of the Heroes are various challenges to test their minds and spirits to prove they are worthy of receiving the oracle's blessing.
In the main entrance hall:
- A grand main hall, made of rough stone walls and floor 
- The hall so dark you cannot see the ceiling stretching above 
- The entire space feels ancient, untouched
- On each wall to the side, torches
- Along the walls, what appear to be guards made of stone
- In front of them, across the massive hall, ***the walls seem to be shifting***
- Three entrances to the following rooms constantly change and shift.
- When the players draw near, the rooms 'solidify' and stop shifting
- **DC 8 Int check - the caves are almost sentient, shifting with the very Heroes that inhabit it and testing them in unique ways**
#### Apollo's Statue
- In a relatively well lit room, stands the Grand Apollo
- A marvelous marble beauty that almost shines among the dark stone walls of this place
- In this room, a hoarde of treasure - gold, silver, gems and all sorts of artifacts lay spread about in small hills and mountains 
- Immediately after the entrance is written:
  "These Treasures are not yours to take. 
  Touch nothing but what you must"
- The statue itself is an almost perfect depiction of Apollo - ripped, tall, almost too beautiful to look at.
  He appears as if playing an instrument, with fingers curled, but no such instrument is in the statues hand 
- **When the players put the lute into his hands, Apollo plays a beautiful song, and the far door Lights up with an 'A'**
  **Apollo then gently offers the players the Oracles Lute**
- **If the players touch anything besides the lute, he attacks them**
- Apollo Stats:
	- Hp: 30
	- Is **immune to piercing damage** (marble baby)
	- Hits for <mark style="background: #930000A6;">1d8</mark> blunt damage with his fists 
	- <mark style="background: #4886FF;">Might</mark> stat: 10 
	- All other stats: 6
####  Wall Paintings
- In a marvelous, oddly well lit room, inside of this cavernous space is an elongated room.
- On the floor near the entrance is written 
- It is decorated from ceiling to floor with various depictions of Greek heroes. 
- Hercules, Perseus, Odysseus, Achilles and many more are all featured depicted doing their heroic (or not so heroic) deeds
- The only characters our  Heroes do not recognize are depictions of five heroes that oddly resemble them.
- **On a DC 7 Perception check, the Heroes notice that these are not just drawings of them, they are deep carvings into the stone, painted to look flat**
- As the investigation is ongoing, the players notice at the end of the room two artifacts - a bow and a spear
- **As soon as the players touch on of the artifacts, the walls begin to close in on them**
- **The Heroes can then hide in the crevices to escape death, or pass a DC 15 Agility check to make it to the entrance** 
- When the Heroes clear the cave, a large 'B' shines on the entrance
#### Mirrors
- In a relatively small room (to the other massive halls), a humble room unfolds before the Heroes
- On every wall, a dark mirror. 
- When the Heroes look in the mirrors, they see idealized versions of themselves - Better looking, more successful, surrounded by friends and family, Saving (or destroying) Olympus
- **On a DC 6 Perception check they catch a glimpse of a figure crouching in darkness behind them in the mirror**
- **On a DC 10 Intuition check they understand that a spirit is attacking them, but can only be seen in the mirrors**
- ***Each time the players wish to attack the spirit, they must first clear a DC 4 Perception check to find it in one of the mirrors.*** 
- ***The Spirit cannot block or dodge, and attacks each turn for 1d6 blunt damage with what appears to be a large hammer***
- The spirit is of Draco, like Narcissus Draco was a hero that fell a little too much in love with his reflection in this mirror and died in the caves.
- Draco says that he will be bound to this place so long as the mirrors stay unbroken
- **if the Heroes break the mirrors for him he gives them the Oracles Hammer**
- When they defeat/befriend Draco, the letter $\Gamma$ appears on the door
