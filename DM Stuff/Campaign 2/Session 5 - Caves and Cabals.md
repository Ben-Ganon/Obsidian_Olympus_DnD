# Delphi Caves

# The Spiral
- As the Heroes descend into the caves in the tight black spiral, each hero is shown a vision:
	- Amara:
		- Amara finds herself suddenly in a golden field of wheat
		- She can sense that in this moment she is not Amara at all - she is simply seeing the world through another woman's eyes
		- She is waiting for someone
		- A strong, dark man with eyes shining in blue and green like a peacocks tail emerges from the tall stalks, looking lovingly at her:
		  "Helena, I cannot stay long. 
		  My father is looking for me - he wont be happy if he finds us together.
		  But know that If you wish, I will run away with you. I know we can be happy"
		- Amara can feel herself saying as the girl: "Herakles, please take me away!"
		- A sudden explosion of pink fog emerges between them
		- "Ah Ah Ah, no romance for Hera's special boy"
		- The fog attacks her, aiming to lodge itself in her throat. 
		- Amara realizes that is not a vision of the future or the past, but of the present - She can save this girl if she tries hard enough
		- What does she do?
	- Thalassios:
		- Thalassios is in a dark room.
		  He can feel heavy chains wrapped around him.
		  He is a monster unlike any other - a monster of lust and secrets.
		  A door opens, and through it - a beautiful blonde woman steps in.
		  He cannot seem to glean if this is Aphrodite or Elissa.
		  It does not matter - in this moment, they are the same to him - cruel mistresses using him for their own purposes.
		  The figure speaks "hello vile creature, I have a task for you."
		  She shoves a bound and gagged Chara at him "Kill."
		  What does Thalassios do?
	- Aeneas:
		- Aeneas is in a grand throne room, like none he has seen before
		- On the walls, beautiful paintings of bulls in reds and blacks
		- On a throne of Obsidian rests a young man in his late teens, clad in a dark hood 
		- Aeneas is looking up to him from another's body
		- It is Lysander
		- Aeneas can feel himself say "My liege, the Heroes have escaped me"
		- The man on the throne spits out "shame. You know I don't accept failure. Next time the Heroes escape you, 
		  I will add you to the list of sacrifices! what do you have to say for yourself"
		- In this moment, Aeneas feels godly power from Ares surging in him, and for just a moment Lysander's eyes glow red, and he seems oddly scared, a face he does not often make. 
		- What does Aeneas say to the stranger?
	- Orphea:
		- Orphea is on a hill overlooking a small village on the island of Corfu
		- In the distance, more villages pop up among the hills and valleys
		- Everything is burning
		- In the distance, screaming
		- Immediately below her, her town is being attacked
		- Does Orphea descend toward the town to try to protect them?
		- As she descends, her rage comes to be as fire - her skin is molten bronze, her eyes literally ablaze with fury
		- She encounters the first pillager - a tall man with the heads of three gorgons on his belt
		- Next, she encounters another pillager - but this time something is different.
			- Only a young boy, it seems he did not kill any gorgons and is horrified at what is happening around him.
			- He tries to stop another pillager from killing a gorgon child but cannot overcome him
			- What does Orphea do?
	- Theodore:
		- Theodore is atop mount Olympus
		- He asks himself "how did I get here?"
		- Suddenly the realization dawns on him all at once: he is holding Zeus.
		- His friends watch on as in one hand a massive sword is pointed at the king of Olympus, and in the other the king himself is beaten bloody
		- Nearby his friends are shackled, begging for him to stop, reconsider, join them again and just return to a peaceful life
		- Beside him, a young man, whispering in his ear "Do it, and I will grant you more power than you have ever dreamed of"
		- What does Theodore do?

# The Caverns
![[Oracle Caves 1.png | 400]]
In front of the Heroes are various challenges to test their minds and spirits to prove they are worthy of receiving the oracle's blessing.
In the main entrance hall:
- A grand main hall, made of rough stone walls and floor 
- The hall so dark you cannot see the ceiling stretching above 
- The entire space feels ancient, untouched
- On each wall to the side, torches
- Along the walls, what appear to be guards made of stone
- In front of them, across the massive hall, ***the walls seem to be shifting***
- Three entrances to the following rooms constantly change and shift.
- When the players draw near, the rooms 'solidify' and stop shifting
- **DC 8 Int check - the caves are almost sentient, shifting with the very Heroes that inhabit it and testing them in unique ways**
## Apollo's Statue
- In a relatively well lit room, stands the Grand Apollo
- A marvelous marble beauty that almost shines among the dark stone walls of this place
- In this room, a hoard of treasure - gold, silver, gems and all sorts of artifacts lay spread about in small hills and mountains 
- Immediately after the entrance is written:
  **"If in the Oracle you trust,** 
  **Touch nothing but what you must.
  Should you stray from this command,
  Prepare to make your last stand"**
- The statue itself is an almost perfect depiction of Apollo - ripped, tall, almost too beautiful to look at.
  He appears as if playing an instrument, with fingers curled, but no such instrument is in the statues hand.
- Then, the players see it: Up high on a wall, the Lyre is pinned to the wall by an arrow.
- To get the Lyre, the players must either reach it or knock it down with another object:
	- Hit it with an arrow **{DC 5 Dexterity}**
	- Hit it with an object **{DC 10 Dexterity}**
	- Reach the object by scaling the wall **{DC 7 Might}**
- **If the players put the Lyre into his hands, Apollo plays a beautiful song, and the far door Lights up with an '$\alpha$'**
  **Apollo then gently offers the players the Oracles Lyre**
- **If the players touch anything besides the Lyre, he attacks them**
- Apollo Stats:
	- Hp: 30
	- Is **immune to piercing damage** (marble baby)
	- Hits for <mark style="background: #930000A6;">1d8</mark> blunt damage with his fists 
	- <mark style="background: #4886FF;">Might</mark> stat: 10 
	- All other stats: 6
##  Wall Paintings
- In a marvelous, oddly well lit room, inside of this cavernous space is an elongated room.
- On the floor near the entrance is written:
  **"The Oracle has seen all sins and virtues,
  and now, dear heroes, you must choose
  To Bash or Bullseye, don't be shy
  Unless you note the stories on the walls
  You will become a ghost within theses halls"**
- It is decorated from ceiling to floor with various depictions of Greek heroes. 
- **{DC 2 Intuition}** Hercules, Perseus, Odysseus, Achilles and many more are all featured depicted doing their heroic (or not so heroic) deeds
- The only characters our  Heroes do not recognize are depictions of **five heroes** on the **left wall** that are not painted yet, and oddly resemble them.
- Each hero on both walls is painted in vibrant shades of orange, red and bronze on a black background.
- **On a {DC 5 Perception} check, the Heroes notice that these are not just drawings of them, they are deep carvings into the stone, painted to look flat, but are actually just their width into the stones.**
- As the investigation is ongoing, the players notice at the end of the room two artifacts - a bow and a hammer
- **As soon as the players touch on of the artifacts, the *right wall* begins to close in on them**
- **The Heroes can then hide in the crevices to escape death, or pass a {DC 15 Agility} check to make it to the entrance** 
- When the Heroes clear the cave, a large '$\beta$' shines on the entrance
## Mirrors
- In a relatively small room (to the other massive halls), a humble room unfolds before the Heroes
- On the floor near the entrance is written:
  **"These mirrors show what most you wanted.
  Take care or forever become haunted"**
- On every wall, a dark mirror. 
- When the Heroes look in the mirrors, they see idealized versions of themselves -
	- **What does each Hero see in the mirror**?
- **On a {DC 6 Perception} check they catch a glimpse of a figure crouching in darkness behind them in the mirror**
- **On a {DC 10 Intuition} check they understand that a spirit is attacking them, but can only be seen in the mirrors**
- ***Each time the players wish to attack the spirit, they must first clear a {DC 4 Perception} check to find it in one of the mirrors.*** 
- ***The Spirit cannot block or dodge, and attacks each turn for 1d6 piercing damage with what appears to be a sort-of spear***
- The spirit is of Draco, like Narcissus Draco was a hero that fell a little too much in love with his reflection in this mirror and died in the caves.
- Draco says that he will be bound to this place so long as the mirrors stay unbroken
- **if the Heroes break the mirrors for him he gives them the Oracles Spear**
- When they defeat/befriend Draco, the letter $\gamma$ appears on the door

## The Two Guardians
As the players finish all three of the rooms, the entrances to the previous rooms shift and change, stone walls fold and shift until a new entrance appears.
- A stone arch carved with the face of Janus, the two faced god
- **{DC 6 Intuition}** the players remember that Janus is the god of choices and doors, this carving could symbolize the choice they have to make in the next room.
- A small simple room appears before the Heroes.
- The floors are lined with inviting wood and carpet
- On the other end of the small room, two doors and two stone guardians standing in front of them
- The guardians are stone depictions of snake-men hybrid, their heads like pythons and their bodies are muscular men
- One holds a stone mace, the other a stone hammer
- On the wood before them is carved:
  **"One of us tells only truth, The other only lies,
  Behind one door is your goal, behind the other your demise
  Which is which to you a mystery - So ask one guard a question, one and one alone.
  Then speak aloud your choice of door so you may pass to the unknown.
  "**
- If the players attack the guards or choose the wrong door the guardians attacks

| Guard  | Hp  | Attacks for      |     |
| ------ | --- | ---------------- | --- |
| Mace   | 20  | 2d6 blunt damage |     |
| Hammer | 20  | 2d6 blunt damage |     |
- The Heroes can also ask a question to make the guards fight each other and then pass while they are distracted

## Potions

- As the Heroes solve the final riddle, they see two of the bottles glow in a bright red light, and when they stop glowing they have a small scroll underneath them that reads 'Drink in case of emergency, Love, Aphrodite <3'
- They get two health potions that can be **drank as a bonus action to restore 3d6 Hp** 


## Stone Minotaurs

- In the room, four stone minotaurs stand at each corner
- On the floor is written:
  "As long as one of us still stands
  The others will together band"
- The minotaurs attack the players:

| Name  | Hp Total | Curr Hp | Hits for         |
| ----- | -------- | ------- | ---------------- |
| M1    | 10       | 10      | Spear 1d6 Pierce |
| M2    | 10       | 10      | Hammer 1d6 Blunt |
| M3    | 10       | 10      | Spear 1d6 Pierce |
| Lenny | 10       | 10      | Spear 1d6 Pierce |
- Revive with 1/2 hp after a single round.
  To win, the PC’s must deal each finishing blow on the same round.
  


### The Oracle

- At the Oracles base, a grand temple emerges
- The ceilings here are taller than the entrance, like this place used to house a giant beast once
- along the walls are stationed stone guards much like the rooms before
	- The guards are a mix of human, and animal headed human hybrids - snakes, foxes, bulls and all manor of other guards are stationed to guard the oracle
- Near the entrance is a huge room built from stone slabs, the door to it locked.
- Oddly, no priests come to greet them - Amara knows usually the eunuchs are very happy to see heroes arrive. 
- Instead, a tall red headed woman greets them. 
- She introduces herself as Selene, the new guardian of the temple
- Doesn't look like a priestess to them
- She tells them to wait while the Oracle prepares to hear the prophecy 
- They see a large room carved into the stone on the far side of the room 
- Selene yells to one of her guards to start the ritual 
- Thick drapes that now hang open separate the spaces, and beyond them they can peek at a young girl of about 15, grinding down flowers and herbs and sprinkling them into a huge crack in the floor where yellow vapor rises up from the ground. 
- As the Oracle grinds and sprinkles, she sings a hymn to apollo asking for a prophecy
- While they wait, Selene asks them why are they here
	- You know, I am a daughter of Artemis. 
	- She forced my coward of a mother to abandon me, but my mother couldn't even do that, and left me to some farmers.
	- I grew up poor, knowing I had real parents, strong parents but both of them were too scared to woman up and raise me
	- The only thing I knew was rage at Olympus, impotent rage
	- Until I met Aphelios
	- Amara, Thalassios and Orphea have known nothing but suffering, and the Olympians did nothing for them
	- So why serve the Olympians? 
	- What if they could be kings in their own realms, make their own decisions about their fate instead of waiting for some Oracle to decide how their story ends
	- I can show you the way, all you have to do is abandon Olympus, and make a human sacrifice to our god, and you will be free from these shackles of prophecy
