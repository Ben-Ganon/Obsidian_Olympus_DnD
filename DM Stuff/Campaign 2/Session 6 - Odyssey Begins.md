- Our Heroes have vanquished Selene
- Level up to 4
- They can receive [[The Prophecy from the Oracle]] 
- In the room where the priests were being held, is a small obsidian box containing the [[Black Key Blade]]
- The Heroes can then travel anywhere in Greece, specifically to:
	- Thera - Persephone is being held in the green inferno
	- Gates of hades - where are they?
	- Birthplace of Minos (Crete)

# Thera

- Thera is an island overtaken by cancerous foliage and flowers
- the small town on the bay has been overtaken by weeds and cannot be accessed by boat 
- In the dense forests, a Nemean Lion stalks the Heroes as they traverse
- In the forest, they can see a mysterious **red flower with a golden dewy substance flowing from it**
- They cannot beat it outright, and must flee unless they know how to beat it

## The Town of Thera
- The townsfolk have all started to merge with the plant life, and also started to lose their minds and memories
- The houses, the boats in the bay, the Agora, all overtaken by giant crawling green tendrils.
- The townsfolk don't know exactly what's going on - only the local witch **Daphne** can remember anything
### Daphne
- In a dilapidated house, the only one that seems to have escaped the giant green tendrils
- Around the house is a circle of odd runes, in the shapes of crescent moons, torches, and snakes
- Only woman in the town who seems to remember anything from more than a week ago 
- A few months ago there was a green explosion somewhere up the mountain in the island.
- Since then they have been shut in - Something stalks the forest, and the bay is so overgrown with seaweed and water-lilies  that boats cannot come or go
- Only one man has entered the forest and survived - Kastor, the town mayor. But he won't talk about it with anyone about.
- Daphne has been trying to bypass the green for a while now, so far with no success. 
- Every time someone goes out they are completely lost
- If they do not return within the day, their shredded corpse turns up at the edge of the town
- The path seems to be obscured by some wild magic
-  Maybe godly essence can make them part way for her and get off the island?
### Kastor
- In the town hall, which was once made of shining white marble, is now overgrown madness
- Every column is a pillar of green, every pool infested with lilies and weeds
- Kastor himself is stuck to the wall of his office
- It appears he has been here a while
- Where once large wounds festered, now green sap oozes from him
- His upper body is now tree-like, merged with the wall of bark behind him
- He saw the Lion, tried to kill it thinking it was the cause for this green storm, but did not realize it was immune to all damage because of it's golden mane
- He tried to swipe at it, took a nasty scratch
- Barely made it back to town, and has not moved from here since
- He knows the legend says that only a claw of the beast can harm it, they can try to trap it somehow

## The Ritual

- In the middle of the dense forest on the small mountain in the middle of the island, a large stone platform surrounded by giant stone columns stands in defiance of the green.
- These stones are not the usual white marble, but something more ancient, as if carved of the mountain itself.
- On the pillars and on the outskirts of the circle are carved a set of runes the Heroes do not recognize
- Persephone is in the middle guarded by Atlas and a squad of cult goons
- The Heroes see this would be a difficult fight

# The Gates of Hades

- The gates of Hades are hard to find, since they keep moving all around Greece
- They usually spawn near a river, lake, or stream
- The only ones who would know where it's going to spawn next would be either priests of Hades or his children, someone with a deep connection to the underworld
- The Priests of Hades 
- At the Gates, the players find a scroll under a rock next to the entrance:
  "To whoever finds this.
  I hope it's you Lysander.
  If you found this, it means I am still inside Hades looking for Minos in Tartarus. 
  Don't close the Gates."
-
