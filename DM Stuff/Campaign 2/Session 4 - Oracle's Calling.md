## In Athens
- The Heroes have acquired [[The Black Key]]'s Eye
- Aeneas has stolen three important documents from Lysanders office:
	- A letter from a Persian official:
	  "Dear Lysander,
	  You have my thanks for your help with the intel on the secret Athenian harbors. 
	  This information will serve Cyrus well. 
	  As for your desired secret - It is my displeasure to inform you that Chara is in fact the daughter of Raivah, 
	  the previous emissary before me. 
	  We do not know who the mother is, but you can be sure we will find out. 
	  Until next time, Arash"
	- A letter written in a scribbly immature hand :
	  "Lysander,
	  I hope you received the Black Key Eye as I instructed.
	  The mission is fulfilled. The gates are open. 
	  Make sure the Heroes never leave Athens -
	   if they close the gates everything we have worked so hard for will be destroyed.
	  N
	  "
	- A final letter:
	  "As you commanded, should the Heroes survive the masquerade I will position cult members on the streets to and catch them.
	  They will not get past me.
	  Hector.
	  "
- The Heroes know their next step is to head to the Oracle in Delphi
- But the Heroes are not safe yet:
	- Hector has been sent by Lysander to prevent the Heroes from leaving Athens
	- What do the Heroes do?
	- (**Thalassios heads to Elissa**)

## The Way to Delphi

## Delphi Caves

![[Oracle Caves.png | 400]]

### The Spiral
- As the Heroes descend into the caves in the tight black spiral, each hero is shown a vision:
	- Amara:
		- Amara finds herself suddenly in a golden field of wheat
		- She can sense that in this moment she is not Amara at all - she is simply seeing the world through another woman's eyes
		- She is waiting for someone
		- A strong, dark man with eyes shining in blue and green like a peacocks tail emerges from the tall stalks, looking lovingly at her:
		  "Helena, I cannot stay long. 
		  My father is looking for me - he wont be happy if he finds us together.
		  But know that If you wish, I will run away with you. I know we can be happy"
		- Amara can feel herself saying as the girl: "Herakles, please take me away!"
		- A sudden explosion of pink fog emerges between them
		- "Ah Ah Ah, no romance for Hera's special boy"
		- The fog attacks her, aiming to lodge itself in her throat. 
		- Amara realizes that is not a vision of the future or the past, but of the present - She can save this girl if she tries hard enough
		- What does she do?
	- Thalassios:
		- Thalassios is in a dark room.
		  He can feel heavy chains wrapped around him.
		  He is a monster unlike any other - a monster of lust and secrets.
		  A door opens, and through it - a beautiful blonde woman steps in.
		  He cannot seem to glean if this is Aphrodite or Elissa.
		  It does not matter - in this moment, they are the same to him - cruel mistresses using him for their own purposes.
		  The figure speaks "hello vile creature, I have a task for you."
		  She shoves a bound and gagged Chara at him "Kill."
		  What does Thalassios do?
	- Aeneas:
		- Aeneas is in a grand throne room, like none he has seen before
		- On the walls, beautiful paintings of bulls in reds and blacks
		- On a throne of Obsidian rests a young man in his late teens, clad in a dark hood 
		- Aeneas is looking up to him from another's body
		- It is Lysander
		- Aeneas can feel himself say "My liege, the Heroes have escaped me"
		- The man on the throne spits out "shame. You know I don't accept failure. Next time the Heroes escape you, 
		  I will add you to the list of sacrifices! what do you have to say for yourself"
		- In this moment, Aeneas feels godly power from Ares surging in him, and for just a moment Lysander's eyes glow red, and he seems oddly scared, a face he does not often make. 
		- What does Aeneas say to the stranger?
	- Orphea:
		- Orphea is on a hill overlooking a small village on the island of Corfu
		- In the distance, more villages pop up among the hills and valleys
		- Everything is burning
		- In the distance, screaming
		- Immediately below her, her town is being attacked
		- Does Orphea descend toward the town to try to protect them?
		- As she descends, her rage comes to be as fire - her skin is molten bronze, her eyes literally ablaze with fury
		- She encounters the first pillager - a tall man with the heads of three gorgons on his belt
		- Next, she encounters another pillager - but this time something is different.
			- Only a young boy, it seems he did not kill any gorgons and is horrified at what is happening around him.
			- He tries to stop another pillager from killing a gorgon child but cannot overcome him
			- What does Orphea do?
	- Theodore:
		- Theodore is atop mount Olympus
		- He asks himself "how did I get here?"
		- Suddenly the realization dawns on him all at once: he is holding Zeus.
		- His friends watch on as in one hand a massive sword is pointed at the king of Olympus, and in the other the king himself is beaten bloody
		- Nearby his friends are shackled, begging for him to stop, reconsider, join them again and just return to a peaceful life
		- Beside him, a young man, whispering in his ear "Do it, and I will grant you more power than you have ever dreamed of"
		- What does Theodore do?

### The Caverns
![[Oracle Caves.png | 500]]

In front of the Heroes are various challenges to test their minds and spirits to prove they are worthy of receiving the oracle's blessing.
In the main entrance hall:
- A grand main hall, made of rough stone walls and floor 
- The hall so dark you cannot see the ceiling stretching above 
- The entire space feels ancient, untouched
- On each wall to the side, torches
- Between them, what appear to be guards made of stone
- In front, three large stone archways lead into rooms they cannot yet see
#### Apollo's Statue
- In a relatively well lit room, stands the Grand Apollo
- A marvelous marble beauty that almost shines among the dark stone walls of this place
- In this room, a hoarde of treasure - gold, silver, gems and all sorts of artifacts lay spread about in small hills and mountains 
- Immediately after the entrance is written:
  "These Treasures are not yours to take. 
  Touch nothing but what you must"
- The statue itself is an almost perfect depiction of Apollo - ripped, tall, almost too beautiful to look at.
  He appears as if playing an instrument, with fingers curled, but no such instrument is in the statues hand 
- **When the players put the lute into his hands, Apollo plays a beautiful song, and the far door Lights up with an 'A'**
  **Apollo then gently offers the players the lute**
- **If the players touch anything besides the lute, he attacks them**
####  Wall Paintings
- In a marvelous, oddly well lit room, inside of this cavernous space is an elongated room.
- It is decorated from ceiling to floor with various depictions of Greek Heroes. 
- Hercules, Perseus, and Odysseus are all featured starring
