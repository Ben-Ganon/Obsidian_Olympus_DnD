## In Athens
- The Heroes have acquired [[The Black Key]]'s Eye
- Aeneas has stolen three important documents from Lysanders office:
	- A letter from a Persian official:
	  "Dear Lysander,
	  You have my thanks for your help with the intel on the secret Athenian harbors. 
	  This information will serve Cyrus well. 
	  As for your desired secret - It is my displeasure to inform you that Chara is in fact the daughter of Raivah, 
	  the previous emissary before me. 
	  We do not know who the mother is, but you can be sure we will find out. 
	  Until next time, Arash"
	- A letter written in a scribbly immature hand :
	  "Lysander,
	  I hope you received the Black Key Eye as I instructed.
	  The mission is fulfilled. The gates are open. 
	  Make sure the Heroes never leave Athens -
	   if they close the gates everything we have worked so hard for will be destroyed.
	  N
	  "
	- A final letter:
	  "As you commanded, should the Heroes survive the masquerade I will position cult members on the streets to and catch them.
	  They will not get past me.
	  Hector.
	  "
- The Heroes know their next step is to head to the Oracle in Delphi
- But the Heroes are not safe yet:
	- Hector has been sent by Lysander to prevent the Heroes from leaving Athens
	- What do the Heroes do?
	- (**Thalassios heads to Elissa**)

## The Way to Delphi
- The group encounter a house being taken over by the cult, doing some sort of ritual sacrifice with the wife of a farmer.
- The farmer is being held hostage on the side of the road
