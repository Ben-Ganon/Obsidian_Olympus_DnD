### A Call to Action

Our Intrepid Heroes are gathered at the acropolis to celebrate the Summer Solstice, each tending to their own activities.

Suddenly, a giant crack of thunder is heard throughout the city.
A lightning bolt strikes the main plaza. 
The plaza and people unharmed, the heroes can see an impossibly large man (around 3 meters in height) kneeling in the impact zone.
"Malakas, I'll never get used to that"
He rises up, snaps his fingers and the dust evaporates from him.
He looks to be quite young, simultaneously teenage,  child, and young adult, with golden eyes, shaggy brown hair and a quirky, mischievous smile.
In his hands, a large bronze staff is writhing - the Caduceus.
He seems quite twitchy, speaking fast and with a certain haste to his words - like he's trying to wrap up a meeting because he is late to his second job delivering mail.
He starts to levitate slightly, and his voice beams across the Acropolis:
"Good citizens of our glorious Athens!"
The crowd is stunned. Everybody knows the gods exist, and many of them have seen both miracles and monsters, but having a god visit you directly is either incredible news or a terrible omen.
Considering the weather, the people in the Acropolis aren't very optimistic.
"I have come to aide you in your time of need!
You've probably noticed the horrible weather. 
Not my dad for sure. However, we're pretty sure this is because Persephone is missing".
Gasps arise from the crowd. They all suspected this was the case, but having a god confirm it was something else entirely.
How could a god be...missing?
"To tackle this, the Olympians have decided to assemble a small team of heroes to try to address this.. **Problem**"
A small scrolls pops into his hands.
He unfurls it, and starts reading:

"I am hereby summoning our Heroes:
- Amara, Daughter of Aphrodite
- Thalassios, son of Aphrodite
- Theodore, Son of Aphrodite
- Epaminondas, Son of Ares
- Orphea, Daughter of Hephaestus


Step forward mighty Heroes, so that you may receive the god's blessings on this difficult journey"
The crowd is aghast with murmurs of excitement and anticipation.
Our heroes step forward tentatively, not knowing whether this spells glory or doom.

Hermes tells the heroes they are chosen for the task of finding Persephone, freeing her from her captors, and renewing the spring in Greece. 
Not a small task, and yet he speaks about it like it's getting some food from a vendor or delivering a letter - just another chore.
Hermes explains to the heroes they must consult the Oracle at Delphi to officially start their quest. 
before they go, Hermes gives them some Boons from their patrons - a gesture of goodwill to show the Olympians care about their children. 

- What does each Hero feel about this summons?

### Dark Tidings

"Alright gang! So for now stay, enjoy the festivities, and when you leave I shall bless you with safe travels.
My time is short, and yours even shorter. Get to Hero-ing!"
Hermes smiles and is gone in a flash and light.

- Give players chance to interact

The crowd is silent, but on their faces is a glimmer of hope - the gods are here to help! 
The crowd starts to swarm the players, some giving blessings, some to ask for favors, and some just to touch the Gods chosen heroes.

Out of the grand temple bursts a priestess clad in deep blue robes and crowned in a golden tiara. 
The horde of bystanders seem to recognize her - and also seem to have a healthy fear of this woman - as if she exudes an aura of cunning so intense one cannot help but to shrink in its presence. 
Her storm-grey eyes have the piercing quality of a hawk, and wherever she looks, people seem to slink away.
A small pathway clears from her position to where the Heroes are being ambushed by well-wishers and she steps through it, her eyes challenging anyone who dares to look.
She arrives, shouting half to the crowd and half to the players: "Heroes! I am <font color="#00b0f0">Penelope Daikos</font>, head priestess of Athena Parthenos. Come with me".

- Do they go with her?

She takes them to the Parthenon.
The grand temple towers over the other, smaller temples to the other Olympians.
Even though in most places Zeus' temple would be largest, in Athens the people are not shy to show their appreciation to their patron God.
As they approach the Parthenon, they spot her - Athena Parthenos.

It was as if Athena herself descended from the heavens.
The massive woman stood cast in solid gold, a golden spear in one hand and Aegis in the other.
On the room-sized shield a snarling gorgon head could be seen etched on the gold. 
On her head a giant helmet, adorned with three galloping horses, and beneath it - a stare so piercing that most people could not bear to look for more than an instant.
In spite of her being made of gold, her eyes remain a cold, intense grey.

As they pass the golden Athena and enter the grand hall of the temple, they see massive marble columns sprouting around them like ancient trees, reaching up to a ceiling you can barely see.
at the back of the hall, another smaller, marble-carved Athena looms over a small fountain.
On either side of her, the biggest olive trees you have ever seen, guarding Athena like two sentinels, as priestesses collect a plethora of the freshest, greenest olives you have ever seen.

Penelope stops suddenly in front of the statue. 
She appears to speak a few words in silence towards the menacing figure above her, and then turns to the PCs:
- "You have absolutely no idea how much trouble you're causing me
  I'm in the middle of fighting for this temple against some ridiculous cult, and here come five heroes to fall right into the hands of the enemy. 
  This is bad. very Bad."
- She doesn't know what exactly, but she's sure the cult is planning something massive against her in the <font color="#ff0000">ritual today</font>
- She asks them to stay and help her prevent whatever is coming
- She tells them what is expected of them (<font color="#ee3fb0">Amara</font> can tell too) - 
	- <font color="#00b050">Delphi - prophecy </font>
- She tells them to <font color="#ff0000">watch out</font> - priests of the gods and veteran heroes have been assaulted by the cult, she expects the same now. 
- She needs them to find out what the cult's plan is until the ceremony, now only half an hour away.
	- <font color="#ff0000">Tips:</font>
		- She knows the ceremony includes a blessing by her to the Olympians
		- Then a big bull is sacrificed to Athena by her
		- The cult's main goal is to harm the Gods in any way they can - by humiliating priests, by killing their chosen Heroes, so they might go after her.
- ***<font color="#ff0000">ONE LAST IMPORTANT THING</font>***:
  Penelope doesn't think it's likely, but if all goes well during the ceremony then before they depart tomorrow she asks them to join her in the <font color="#ff0000">masquerade tonight </font>at <font color="#b540ff">Lysanders mansion</font>. 
  
  Maybe the PCs can help - 
  - A few months ago a sacred artifact was stolen from the temple of Hades in the city catacombs 
  - One of her priestesses told her she heard it had popped up in Lysanders mansion - 
  - maybe the heroes can help her retrieve it?
  - This could help them on their quest - if the retrieve it and promise to give it back at the end of the quest they can use it. 
  - What is it - not exactly clear, the priests of hades 
   
### Sacrifices
As Penelope is sacrificing the bull, dagger in hand, about to strike, a magical veil is pulled and suddenly it is revealed that Chara, gagged and bound, is actually on the table, not the bull. 
Lysander, seeming a little too smug at the situation, calls guards for her arrest
"Athenians, look at what this vile woman has done! Human sacrifice! she and her evil practices are what's causing this cold!"
Lysander calls in three guards to have her arrested. 

- Will the players prevent this from happening?
- <font color="#ff0000">IF THEY DO:</font>
	- They battle the guards, and have to flee from the square
- <font color="#245bdb">IF THEY DON'T</font>
	- The guards take Penelope to the city jail.

### The Masquerade 
At Lysander's mansion the music is wonderful.
The food is plentiful.
The wine is bottomless.
In this palace, every corner is dressed to convey majesty and wealth.
Persian carpets adorn the walls, marble columns adorned with gold and living ivy. 
In every corner of every room stand pitchers of wine and tables heavy with food and other drinks. 
Lavish silken pillows are spread around the rooms, allowing people to rest from the dancing.
In the main hall, a band plays heartily as people dance and caress.
And today all of them are hidden behind beautiful masks imported from across the sea.
Amara knows Lysander's parties are legendary in the city, mostly for their extravagance and partly for his ability to seemingly generate for his guests infinite amounts of wine no matter how much they drink.

At the party many important guests attend:
