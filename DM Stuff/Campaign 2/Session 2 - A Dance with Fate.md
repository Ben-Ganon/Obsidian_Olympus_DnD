Our Intrepid Heroes are gathered at the acropolis to celebrate the Summer Solstice, each tending to their own activities.

Suddenly, a giant crack of thunder is heard throughout the city.
A lightning bolt strikes the main plaza. 
The plaza and people unharmed, the heroes can see an impossibly large man (around 3 meters in height) kneeling in the impact zone.
"Malakas, I'll never get used to that"
He rises up, snaps his fingers and the dust evaporates from him.
He looks to be quite young, simultaneously teenage,  child, and young adult, with golden eyes, shaggy brown hair and a quirky, mischievous smile.
In his hands, a large bronze staff is writhing - the Caduceus.
He seems quite twitchy, speaking fast and with a certain haste to his words - like he's trying to wrap up a meeting because he is late to his second job delivering mail.
He starts to levitate slightly, and his voice beams across the Acropolis:
"Good citizens of our glorious Athens!"
The crowd is stunned. Everybody knows the gods exist, and many of them have seen both miracles and monsters, but having a god visit you directly is either incredible news or a terrible omen.
Considering the weather, the people in the Acropolis aren't very optimistic.
"I have come to aide you in your time of need!
You've probably noticed the horrible weather. 
Not my dad for sure. However, we're pretty sure this is because Persephone is missing".
Gasps arise from the crowd. They all suspected this was the case, but having a god confirm it was something else entirely.
How could a god be...missing?
"To tackle this, the Olympians have decided to assemble a small team of heroes to try to address this.. **Problem**"
A small scrolls pops into his hands.
He unfurls it, and starts reading:

"I am hereby summoning our Heroes:
- Amara, Daughter of Aphrodite
- Thalassios, son of Aphrodite
- Theodore, Son of Aphrodite
- Epaminondas, Son of Ares
- Orphea, Daughter of Hephaestus


Step forward mighty Heroes, so that you may receive the god's blessings on this difficult journey"
The crowd is aghast with murmurs of excitement and anticipation.
Our heroes step forward tentatively, not knowing whether this spells glory or doom.

Hermes tells the heroes they are chosen for the task of finding Persephone, freeing her from her captors, and renewing the spring in Greece. 
Not a small task, and yet he speaks about it like it's getting some food from a vendor or delivering a letter - just another chore.
Hermes explains to the heroes they must consult the Oracle at Delphi to officially start their quest. 
before they go, Hermes gives them some Boons from their patrons - a gesture of goodwill to show the Olympians care about their children. 

- What does each Hero feel about this summons?


"Alright gang! My time is short, and yours even shorter. Get to Hero-ing!"
Hermes smiles and is gone in a flash and light.

- Give players chance to interact

The crowd is silent, but on their faces is a glimmer of hope - the gods are here to help! 
The crowd starts to swarm the players, some giving blessings, some to ask for favors, and some just to touch the Gods chosen heroes.

Out of the grand temple bursts a priestess clad in deep blue robes and crowned in a golden tiara. 
The horde of bystanders seem to recognize her - and also seem to have a healthy fear of this woman - as if she exudes an aura of cunning so intense one cannot help but to shrink in its presence. 
Her storm-grey eyes have the piercing quality of a hawk, and wherever she looks, people seem to slink away.
A small pathway clears from her position to where the Heroes are being ambushed by well-wishers and she steps through it, her eyes challenging anyone who dares to look.
She arrives, shouting half to the crowd and half to the players: "Heroes! I am Penelope Daikos, head priestess of Athena Parthenos. Come with me".
- Do they go with her?
She takes them to the Parthenon, a grand temple towering over the other, smaller temples
