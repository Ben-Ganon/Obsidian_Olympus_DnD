## Freeing Persephone
- The heroes have freed Persephone from her captor Atlas
- Persephone says she has heard all about the Cults plan from Atlas
	- Resurrect Minos, king of the Minoan Empire from Tartarus
	- Make a new god that is a combination of Aphelios, Minos, and Tauros
	- But this process would cost insane amounts of energy
	- So they need to sacrifice Persephone to power this transition
	- Now she is free, Greece was spared this fate
	- ***But***, Aphelios will still try to free Minos, but she's not sure why yet
	- He might try to sacrifice a minor god to return Minos to his full power, then launch a full assault on Greece
- Nyx has been sent to Tartarus to free Minos
- The Gates of Hades are currently on the banks of the Eurotas in Sparta
- As a favor to the heroes for freeing her, Persephone offers to transport them wherever they wish
- When they arrive, She also gives them a gift: [[KodKod]] the magical skull

## Sparta

- The heroes arrive at the gates of Sparta 
- As the guards let them in, it seems the city is empty
- As the heroes pass through the empty streets, they see a in a small alley a small play by a very old man to various kids of very young age
	- The play features a puppet with four faces, and the man tells the story of Ares, each face representing [[City of Sparta#The Four Tenants of Spartan Strength | the four tenants of strength]]
	

### The King

- The king of Sparta, Pleistonax (or Petra), is in his throne room
- Sparta does not accept outsiders participating in the Pit
- If the heroes come to him for approval to participate in The Pit, he will ask them for a favor:
	- He tells them one of his squad heads, Daikos, has been causing shit in Sparta. He would like to get rid of him, but assassination is not the Spartan way. 
	- He asks the heroes to go assassinate Daikos
	- When asked where: "Agora"
- Give them his seal of approval to participate in the Pit.

### The Agora

- All but one persons: Helena
- Amara thinks she recognizes her
