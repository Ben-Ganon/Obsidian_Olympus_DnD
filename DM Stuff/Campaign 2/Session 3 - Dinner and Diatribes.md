## The Masquerade 
At Lysander's mansion the music is wonderful.
The food is plentiful.
The wine is bottomless.
In this palace, every corner is dressed to convey majesty and wealth.
Persian carpets adorn the walls, marble columns adorned with gold and living ivy. 
In every corner of every room stand pitchers of wine and tables heavy with food and other drinks. 
Lavish silken pillows are spread around the rooms, allowing people to rest from the dancing.
In the main hall, a band plays heartily as people dance and caress.
And today all of them are hidden behind beautiful masks imported from across the sea.
Amara knows Lysander's parties are legendary in the city, mostly for their extravagance and partly for his ability to seemingly generate for his guests infinite amounts of wine no matter how much they drink.

But this is no ordinary party. 
The main appeal of tonight's festivities is the masquerade. 
All guests are clad all manner of masks, from ones depicting in animal faces, to ones of of gods and spirits.
The masks are made from many materials, indicating each guests rank and wealth: 
The top generals, priests and rich wear golden masks finely carved and designed, other city officials and merchants wear bronze or silver in elegant lines and curves, and the common peasants and servants wear wooden masks, roughly carved.

***The Secret*** 
- Inside of **Lysander's Office** in the **West Wing**, a drawer of an oak table is a written **scroll** addressed to him from a **Persian Emissary**
- Written in the letter is a **trade of secrets** - 
- In exchange for Lysander's knowledge of **Athenian Secret Harbor locations**, 
  the emissary has revealed to Lysander that **Chara is Persian born** - He does not know when
- He advises Lysander never to let this go public if he wants Elissa's head to continue being attached to her body, as having a priestess of Aphrodite being Persian born could mean disaster

***The Dungeons***
- **Dungeon entrance** is at the **North Wing**, behind a cabinet of scrolls
- The players can feel a breeze coming from behind the scroll case
- Behind one of the scrolls is a button inscribed with the capital Greek letter $\Delta$  that swings the cabinet out
- A stairway leads down into darkness
- At the bottom of the staircase is a long dark hallway illuminated by torches
- On each side of the hallway are many locked cells, some seem empty:

| Cell No. | Prisoner Name | Role                                                                                                            |
| -------- | ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1 - L    | Zeno          | Former Cult member - tried to spy on the cult for Penelope but was caught.<br>He is wearing a gorgon-skin tunic |
| 2 - R    | Empty         |                                                                                                                 |
| 3 - L    | Empty         |                                                                                                                 |
| 4 - R    | Penelope      |                                                                                                                 |
  
- As the players are investigating trying to find Penelope in the dungeons, two guards with wooden bull masks attack them:

|           | Guard | HP  | Curr HP | Weapon / Damage | Defensive Value | Other Stats |
| --------- | ----- | --- | ------- | --------------- | --------------- | ----------- |
| 1 - Jason | 10    | 10  | 10      | Xiphos - d6     | d4              | d6          |
| 2 - Jax   | 6     | 6   | 6       | Xiphos - d6     | d4              | d6          |

***The Artifact*** 
- The artifact is the [[The Black Key]]'s Bow (eye). Located behind a **locked wooden door** in the **West Wing** of the mansion inside **Lysander's Quarters**.
- As the Heroes are mingling and attempting to find out where the artifact is, 
- Three assassins dressed in black robes and bronze bull masks emerge from the crowd and try to attack the players and Themistia.

| Guard      | HP  | Curr HP | Weapon / Damage | Defensive Value | Other Stats |
| ---------- | --- | ------- | --------------- | --------------- | ----------- |
| 1 - Alex   | 10  | 10      | Xiphos - d6     | d4              | d6          |

| 3 - Philo  | 6   | 6       | Akinakes - d4   | -               | d4          |

- If a player is next to her they can try to stop the assassin from killing her
- If not, she dies
  
- Lysander pretends to be sad, says to the crowd "Look at what the cult is doing to this once great city! you all must see now that we need to add more security to the temples to make sure all is proper. I take responsibility for Themistia's death. I will not let it happen again! I will put some of my men as guardians of the priests, and you have my word the temples will return to their glory. "
